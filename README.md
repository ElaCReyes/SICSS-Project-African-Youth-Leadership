# SICSS Project African Youth Leadership

## To do:

- [x] Share the pdf data and list of urls to scrape (Rehana)
- [x] Write proposal (Rehana)
- [/] Scrape URLs (Bonnie and Kadija)
- [/] PDF to text (Ela): output is a dataframe with one column is document name/ID and one column is all of the text as a single string
   **Update**: Extracted data but yet to be in one row per document. 
- [x] Clean text (Ela & ??): remove stop words, special characters, regular expressions, etc.
- [] Tokenize text into individual words to examine term frequency (TBD)
- [] Topic modelling as cleaning (Rehana, using Bonnie's data)
- [] Topic models (Kadija, using Ela's pdf data) (create term document matrix, use LDA) (TBD) [We are using Dr. Stewart's work](http://www.structuraltopicmodel.com).
- [] Work on presentation (Rehana & Kadija) 
-     -> Everyone should upload error screenshots 
-     -> Rehana will prep an overview of the data and research questions
-     -> Questions for next steps? 
- [] Duplication testing of Bonnie and Ela's code (Kadija)
- [] See if there is an easy comparison between webscrapped sites vs pdf (Rehana)
