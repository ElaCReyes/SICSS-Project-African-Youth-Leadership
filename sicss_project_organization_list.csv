Bright Green Enterprise (BGE) has been working on the ground in Tanzania, East Africa since 2010, delivering enterprise and innovation workshops to primary and secondary schools. To-date 100% of this work has been conducted voluntarily and funded by BGE. As well as delivering project-based learning workshops we have also sponsored and supported the annual Science and Innovation Fair at the School of St Jude, in Meru.

We aim to provide a positive reflection and showcase of Tanzanian youth talent that seeks to counter-act the often negative, poverty stereotypes associated with ‘developing’ environments. Our Tanzanian students take part in our international skills-sharing challenge, Creative Disruptors, which aims to showcase both UK and Tanzanian students’ innovative ideas and work.
Our Mission
To provide an innovative education model through project-based learning, bringing teachers into the pedagogical approach through active participation in workshops.

To develop young people’s skills in critical thinking, to foster self-reliance and to encourage a ‘can-do’ attitude to problem-solving social and environmental issues.

To support the core National Curriculum of Tanzania, applying project-based learning to Science, Technology, Geography and Citizenship.

Our Programmes
Our programmes have been designed by a multidisciplinary team of professionals across the private and public sector. We believe this makes us advantageous in our efforts to advance educational development goals – the same ethos we bring into our UK programmes. Our programmes can be (and have been) delivered into the most challenging of environments, from tropical rainforests to remote savannahs.

We understand the many restrictions of delivering curriculum objectives within low-resource environments and have built our programme model to provide all resources necessary for students to complete tasks. We work with a number of on-the-ground organisations including technology makerspaces and have been supported by alternative energy technology companies.

Innovation for Sustainable Development
While there is a main enterprise and skills-development core within our programmes, our entrepreneurship curriculum is complemented by exploration of sustainable pathways to development.

Our organisational structure ensures we always strive to reflect and practice our core values  – to impart ethical and sustainable practice.

The program aims to inspire, empower and equip a new cadre of African leaders by providing the skills and tools for personal, organizational and community transformation. Focus areas include raising leaders, business sustainability and establishing an online resource center.

LEAP Africa offers the iLEAD programme (formerly YDTP) , aimed at transforming mindsets and equipping youth to be value creators and change agents. iLEAD aims to inspire, equip and challenge teachers to be role models of leadership to their students, provide a platform for secondary school youth to acquire skills which are critical to a meaningful and productive existence, stretch the students’ ambition by exposing them to a range of career opportunities and how to seize them and advance youth participation in nation building and community development through development of impactful change projects in their communities.

The iLEAD curriculum has three key focal areas necessary to equip youth for success:

Leadership and life skills – soft skills and attitudes critical to directing the course of life and engaging successfully with others

Entrepreneurship – commercial awareness and the foundational skills for operating an enterprise and managing finances

Employability/Career counseling – broadening the exposure of students to a wide range of career options.

ILEAD transforms teachers and then their students through a training-of-trainers (ToT) approach. LEAP equips and inspires public secondary school teachers to take the students through interactive class sessions, games and illustrative activities. It also allows flexibility in teaching styles and promotes student-led civic engagement through community change project.

Trainers are put through a one-week training of trainers (ToT) workshop with classroom simulations and mock facilitation to provide teachers with practice for curriculum delivery. They are assessed on content assimilation and challenged to develop games and activities that convey the content of the iLEAD curriculum to students in a fun, practical way and mock facilitation.

LEAP manages the iLEAD through a community cluster structure. A community is loosely defined as a cluster of five (5) schools. Three teachers supported by one volunteer are trained to deliver the iLEAD curriculum per school. Each teacher is responsible for training 30 students. A community, therefore, constitutes of five schools, 15 teachers, 15 corporate volunteers, 450 students and 15 change projects.

LEAD THE WAY is a 5-day workshop that empowers teens to understand and harness their full leadership potential. With a focus on values as the foundation for leadership,  teens are given an opportunity to examine their core values and beliefs and start their own leadership journey based on a recognition of their identity, strengths and passion all while having the time of their lives.

At the end of the programme teens are challenged to forge their path, find their voices and mature into innovative and principled leaders.

LEAP Africa is passionate about promoting youth-led social entrepreneurship. In 2004, LEAP Africa initiated the Annual Nigerian Youth Leadership Awards (ANYLA) to celebrate outstanding young people across the country.

Evolving from ANYLA, and with the support of the International Youth Foundation, the Social Innovators Programme and Awards (S.I.P.A) is LEAP Africa’s platform for empowering young change makers to expand social ideas into scalable social enterprises. S.I.P.A celebrates young social innovators between 18 – 35 years, whose ideas and initiatives offer effective solutions to challenges in local communities across Nigeria. Since 2013, LEAP has annually hosted the awards ceremony to celebrate youth social entrepreneurs across Nigeria and induct a new class into the one year Fellowship. Till date 125 change makers have been recognized on this platform.

The SIP 2016/2017 Fellowship began with induction in November 2016 with the support of Union Bank of Nigeria.

The 20 change makers have begun immersion in fellowship through series of training, mentoring and coaching exercises to scale up their initiatives in 2017.

Leadership Institutes: Each Mandela Washington Fellow takes part in a six-week Leadership Institute at a U.S. college or university in one of three tracks: Business, Civic Engagement, or Public Management. The intensive model includes linkages between academic sessions, site visits, professional networking opportunities, leadership training, community service, and organized cultural activities.

Mandela Washington Fellowship Summit: Following the academic component of the Fellowship, the Fellows visit Washington, D.C., for a Summit featuring networking and panel discussions with U.S. leaders from the public, private, and non-profit sectors.

Professional Development Experience: Seventy selected Fellows remain in the United States to participate in a four-week Professional Development Experience with U.S. non-governmental organizations, private companies, and governmental agencies that relate to their professional interests and goals. The PDE is designed to give Fellows practical training and the opportunity to learn transferable skills, expand their professional networks, and apply concepts learned at their Institutes to real-world situations in the U.S. context.

Africa-based activities
Upon returning to their home countries, Fellows continue to build the skills they have developed during their time in the United States through support from U.S. embassies, the YALI Network, USAID, the Department of State, and affiliated partners. Through these experiences, select Mandela Washington Fellows have access to ongoing professional development and networking opportunities, as well as support for their ideas, businesses, and organizations.

We enable the continent’s youth to shape the continent’s future through Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) education- training Africa’s next generation of leaders. AIMS South Africa is one of the centres of excellence for training, research and public engagement in Cape Town, South Africa. AIMS South Africa was established in 2003 as a partnership project of the following 6 universities: Cambridge, Cape Town, Oxford, Paris Sud XI, Stellenbosch, and Western Cape.
AIMS is a call to action to:
Empower Africa’s youth to shape its future
Solve global challenges
Drive economic self-sufficiency
“We believe that the next Einstein will be African and that he or she will develop solutions that cross borders and change lives.”
What We Do
AIMS is incubating mathematical sciences to address global challenges. We offer a structured Master’s in mathematical sciences and are focused on scientific training, cutting-edge research and public engagement. Our activities include:
TRAINING: AIMS South Africa provides a one-year structured Master’s program in Mathematical Sciences that is enabling a critical mass of African academics, researchers and entrepreneurs on the cutting-edge of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). There are intakes in August and January. AIMS South Africa also offers specialised courses as part of regular honours and Master’s degree programs at South African universities. AIMS South Africa hosts research and training workshops.
RESEARCH: The AIMS South Africa Research Centre was launched in 2008 and its mission is to conduct and foster outstanding research and learning in the mathematical sciences thus contributing to the next generation of pan-African leaders in many spheres and the advancement of African science and academia within a multicultural environment.
PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT: AIMS South Africa through the AIMS Schools Enrichment Centre (AIMSSEC) is building the capacity of Africa’s teachers through training programs to increase the pipeline of math and science students. AIMS South Africa hosts and participates in events and exhibitions to promote mathematical sciences in general. AIMS South Africa also has a public lecture series.
Why We Do It
Mathematical sciences underlies every modern technology and its application is found in every field. Africa, which will be home to 40 per cent of the world’s youth (18 and under) by 2050, is undergoing unprecedented transformation and growth- investing in mathematical sciences is critical to drive the continent’s development forward.
STEM education is key to finding solutions for African and global challenges.

We are making this shift for a number of reasons, but primary among them is to impact more lives more quickly. We strongly believe that Africa is rapidly approaching an inflection point where they will desperately need as many job-creating leaders and entrepreneurs as possible. By focusing our funding on shorter cycle educational opportunities, such as the ones we are piloting with our partners at (1) TekZone in Cameroon, and (2) with BIG Ideas in Rwanda and Uganda, we believe we can help create a qualified workforce to help entrepreneurs and to embolden the entrepreneurs themselves.

1. Ensuring that our students are incentivized to seek out additional scholarships and grants, thereby guaranteeing the most efficient distribution of funds for The ALB and increasing our ability to fund more students.

2. Creating a dignified relationship with our scholars and giving them the opportunity to be active participants in providing a future ALB scholar with the same set of opportunities that were availed to them. By doing this we build a strong sense of community among our students.

​​Good question. The fact that several of the stated qualifying countries are African makes me think that it would qualify on the basis of an Africa target (though not exclusive targeting). The language of enabling students from low income backgrounds to pursue “career development” also makes me think that might be enough to meet the leadership criteria, in the sense of career/professional advancement. I’m okay with including it. ​@Christiana K​ what do you think?",,PL,84,,

This is part of the larger organization’s dedication to orphans and to supporting educational opportunities through emotional healing and empowerment for self growth and reliance. The program in Africa is focused specifically on training the future leaders of Sub-Saharan Africa. Students can study at any university in the world though Japanese universities are encouraged. Students will also receive support in crafting a research proposal for a project which will address issues in their local community as well as get access to a network of mentors, students and alumni who will support them through university.

Ashinaga supports orphaned students, as well as children with a parent suffering from a physical or mental disability that prevents them from working. Our support is divided into three main fields: enabling access to education, providing emotional support, and empowering our students. These fields apply to all of our activities in Japan and Sub-Saharan Africa, including the Ashinaga Africa Initiative.

Access to Education
A family is put under significant financial strain when a parent passes away or is unable to work due to a mental or physical disability. Through our extensive annual surveys throughout Japan, we have found that young people in such households are much less likely to progress to university after graduating high school. Many instead choose to go straight to work due to financial and family concerns, giving up on previous aspirations.

To address this, we have spent decades providing financial aid in the form of interest-free loans, emergency grants, conditional scholarships, and subsidized housing. These measures reduce the financial burden of high school and university studies for parents and guardians, and open up avenues of opportunity for disadvantaged young people.

THE ASHINAGA AFRICA INITIATIVE
Contributing to Sub-Saharan Africa’s development through higher education abroad

Ashinaga established the Ashinaga Africa Initiative in 2014 with the aim of contributing to Sub-Saharan Africa’s long-term development by empowering a generation of future leaders. Our students receive an international university education, comprehensive support throughout their studies, and the means to return home and be agents of positive change.

How to Apply

The Key Elements of the Ashinaga Africa Initiative
Beyond simply providing financial aid, our program has five key features to ensure that students receive the education, training, networks, and opportunities needed to realize their vision for Sub-Saharan Africa.

The Selection: Selecting talented students is key to the effectiveness of the Ashinaga Africa Initiative. For this reason, we have developed a rigorous selection process in cooperation with embassies, partner NGOs, and local education experts from each country.
The Support: We are with our students every step of the way, with full-time staff available to provide guidance whenever necessary.
The Network: Students are connected to a global network of volunteer mentors, Ashinaga alumni, partner organizations, our Kenjin-Tatsujin International Advisory Council, and fellow students.
The Proposal: During their studies, our students spend four years developing a thoroughly researched proposal addressing an issue faced by their local community.
The Promise: Most importantly, all of our students promise to pass on the benefits of their education. They do this by returning and contributing to Sub-Saharan Africa’s development.
Sub-Saharan Africa
Sub-Saharan Africa is a region of immense vibrancy, innovation, and growth. It has the youngest population of any region, abundant natural resources, and is experiencing rapid economic development.

Even so, Sub-Saharan Africa faces numerous institutional problems that challenge its ability to realize its potential. Moreover, the region has the highest proportion of orphaned youth in the world, many of whom struggle to access education. Ashinaga believes that, when given the opportunity, these orphaned students are capable of academic success and becoming the compassionate leaders that Sub-Saharan Africa needs to excel.

A Generation of New Leaders
All of our students have one shared, distinguishing feature: they have all experienced the psychological pain and economic hardship of being orphaned. We believe that this experience gives all of our students a strong sense of empathy and further drive to prevent such hardships for future generations.

International higher education is a means by which these scholars can gain the tools necessary to address the challenges facing the region. An international education will give Ashinaga Scholars invaluable experience in their academic sector, working across cultures, and living in different societies. We are confident that the empowered Ashinaga Scholars will grow African businesses, strengthen universities, improve governments, and unlock the potential of Sub-Saharan Africa.

Kenjin-Tatsujin
The Kenjin-Tatsujin International Advisory Council is a body of international leaders that forms a key part of the Ashinaga Africa Initiative. They are highly renowned businesspeople, academics, lawmakers, artists, athletes, and entertainers with significant influence within their respective fields.

Kenjin-Tatsujin members lend their support to the Ashinaga Africa Initiative by providing collective input to improve each element of the program, as well as connecting our students to universities, careers, and opportunities to turn their ideas into a reality.

It provides access to postgraduate education, training and professional development opportunities for suitably qualified Africans from eligible countries. On their return to the workplace, Australia Awards Alumni are expected to contribute to the development of their home countries.

The stability, security and prosperity of sub-Saharan Africa are of national interest to Australia. African countries are of global economic and political importance in addressing global economic growth, agricultural productivity, food security and international security. Many African economies are prospering and present increasing opportunities for trade and investment-led development gains for Australia.

Sub-Saharan Africa is a diverse region that faces varying developmental contexts and challenges. Key constraints to economic growth, shared across the continent, including skills shortages, poor enabling environments for business and governance, slow development of key infrastructure, food insecurity and low agricultural productivity, humanitarian crises, as well as gender and other inequalities. These skills shortages are particularly acute at the professional levels. In the public sector, these skills deficits hinder the capacity of governments to deliver services, support sustained growth and address development challenges. To achieve sustained economic growth and competitiveness, more skilled labour and applied industry-related research is required.

Australia’s development assistance is carefully targeted for the greatest impact. It has the capacity to make a difference by targeting sectors where Australian experience and knowledge visibly add value, deepen engagement and continue flexibility and responsiveness within the chosen areas of expertise. Australia Awards – Africa is available to a select number of priority countries, in line with the geographical and sectoral focus for Australian engagement in Africa.

Australia is optimistic about Africa’s future. Australia has eight Diplomatic missions in Africa supporting bilateral relations with sub-Saharan African nations. The first mission, based in South Africa, was opened in 1946.

The awards help build the skills and capacities of Africa’s future leaders in key sectors. In addition, they foster an engaged and influential network of leaders, reformers and advocates, while promoting valuable links between Australia and Africa.

The awards contribute to African leadership and human capacity development in areas of critical skills shortages. All courses are offered in areas where Australia is a world leader and where partner governments have requested assistance, namely in agriculture (including ocean governance), extractives governance and public policy (including trade policy and negotiations, and public-private infrastructure partnerships).

The awards offer Masters Scholarships, tailored Short Courses, and an Alumni program.

Masters Scholarships for study in Australia are offered to high-calibre future leaders across public, private and community sectors.
Short Course awards are offered as formal courses of study and training for up to two months delivered by an institution in Australia or Africa, or a combination of both.
The Alumni program comprises a network of Alumni associations and activities such as ongoing professional development and networking opportunities for registered Alumni.
The awards have a strong focus on equality, emphasising equity and inclusivity for women and people with disabilities. The program’s aim is for an equal number of women and men to receive awards. In addition, the program is recognised for ensuring that people with disabilities, and people working in support of people with disabilities, have access to awards and are well supported while on-Award.

As a Special Advisor to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Jack recognized that by applying ideas from China’s most innovative businesses to their own ventures, participants will have the opportunity to innovate in their home countries. With this opportunity in mind, the eFounders Fellowship was created to find and empower 1000 platform builders who can leverage Alibaba’s experience in China.

With a focus on highlighting breakthrough innovations that have transformed society in China, the program will inspire each participant to think of creative frameworks based on prior expertise and new learnings that can be applied to their own home markets.

Participating entrepreneurs will be given the tools to improve their own ventures, but as ‘New Economy’ pioneers they will be expected to serve as network builders and champions of new ways to approach commerce in their own markets. UNCTAD and Alibaba believe these entrepreneurs can spread powerful new ideas around the world by creating impactful communities and empowering their peers.

The course targets young entrepreneurs as part of an initiative on the digital economy for sustainable development that is jointly organized by the Alibaba Business School and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.

Through our higher education and research funding, project grants and international events programme, our unique approach cultivates a space where activism and research meet.

Canon Collins Trust believes that higher education is empowering for individuals and transformative for society. Southern Africa’s development depends on strong leadership in key fields, which is why we have supported over 3,000 individuals through their studies since 1981. Research and knowledge are crucial tools for addressing some of the most pressing issues in contemporary southern African society, therefore we focus our scholarship provision on enabling access to postgraduate and doctoral studies. On top of a strong academic record and a passion for research, our scholars must demonstrate their commitment to social justice and to employing their skill sets to achieve impact within the wider community. Our focus on education also extends to access to primary and secondary schooling. Through support of our partner Equal Education, the Trust advocates for quality and equality in the South African education system.

Our work is underpinned by a spirit of solidarity rooted in our history in the anti-apartheid struggle. As a result, we are committed to contributing towards a new framework for human rights in southern Africa by supporting high-quality graduates to become the next generation of legal researchers, lawyers and social activists. However, our scholars are in need of more than just study funding; they need strong networks in government and civil society in order to contribute towards an open and just society. We respond to these needs by way of our international events programme, which brings together our scholars, alumni and civil society partners to discuss issues pertaining to human rights and social justice. Our partnerships with the Legal Resources Centre and Wits Justice Project enable our scholars to interact with key change agents in South African civil society, whilst relating their work to achieving impact for some of the most marginalised and excluded citizens.

Canon Collins Trust was founded in 1981 by the British Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa (BDAF). BDAF was born out of the Treason Trial in 1956, when 156 leaders of the ANC and allied organisations were arrested. Many individuals and organisations came together to provide funding for their legal defence. What had been the Treason Trial Fund grew into the British (later International) Defence and Aid Fund established by Canon John Collins (pictured right), which formed branches in Sweden, Norway, Australia and Switzerland and raised funds from all over the world to provide legal assistance to anti-apartheid activists in South Africa.

About CDR
Objectives

Within the framework of cooperating in Masters and PhD programmes, the aim of the African Excellence Centre at UWC in Cape Town is to prepare the next generation of leaders to meet the typical economic, social and political berlinchallenges arising from the development process. The research-oriented training programmes already established at the Ruhr-University of Bochum and the University of the Western Cape have been run in close cooperation for several years now. The course offerings are sourced from the disciplines of economics and social sciences (particularly macroeconomics and political science) and the administrative sciences. The course programme is supplemented by substantial inputs from the fields of project management and empirical social research. The programmes are theory-based but also have a strong empirical focus. Regional case studies are intended to provide scope for analysis from both the macro and micro perspective:

In order to adequately prepare the next generation of leaders through research-oriented training it is not sufficient to have the possibility to award scholarships to promising candidates from all over Sub-Saharan Africa, but it is also necessary to maintain a strong research focus on the work of the centre and to cooperate closely with other leading universities in the region.

The objectives of the centre are mainly implemented within the framework of cooperative study programmes through joint research, teaching and mentoring. At present, such cooperative study programmes are being realized in the MA programme in Development Management (Bochum Programme), the MA programme in Development Studies (ISD), the MPA programme (SoG) and the PhD programme in Development Studies and Public Policy. In order to further promote cooperative research, teaching and mentoring the Centre awards scholarships to excellent applicants from Sub-Sahara Africa for a period of study in these joint programmes; it also offers training in soft skills and German language courses for the scholarship holders of the centre, organises summer schools for the MA students of the Division at the RUB and the UWC and arrange academic conferences of the Division at the UWC and at other universities in the region.

For applicants from Sub-Saharan African countries with an excellent academic record the DRD offers a limited number of DAAD merit scholarships per year.

Scholarships are available for full-time students of

the MA in Development Studies
the Master in Public Administration
the MA in Development Management (Bochum Programme, next deadline 30 November 2019)
(separate online application platform, access and guidelines via ""How to apply"" section of the Bochum programme or via the course homepage)

Scholarships include monthly allowances of 650 Euro plus travel allowances for Master candidates and 900 Euro plus travel allowances for PhD candidates. Tuition and registration fees are covered by the Scholarship Programme. More information about requirements for application and application procedure is provided below.

Apart from full scholarships for participation in one of the above mentioned programmes a number of mobility scholarships for Master students are available each year. These scholarships are aimed at funding a study period in Germany. During such a study period abroad scholarship holders can participate in a Summer School at Ruhr-Univeristy Bochum, complete an internship with a German organization working in the field related to their studies or they can visit Ruhr-Univeristy Bochum during the completion phase of their Master Thesis for intensive supervision periods.
It is not necessary to apply for mobility scholarships before starting your studies.

The East African Development Bank (EADB) was established in 1967 with the remit to provide financial and other support to its member countries, which currently are Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda.  Burundi has applied to become a member state.  It was re-established under its own charter in 1980 after the break-up of the East African Co-operation in 1977. The new charter opened up the Bank to a wider membership and allowed for the introduction of consulting and advisory services.

The EADB’s loan portfolio is spread widely, but more than 60% of its lending is to projects in health and education, hotels and tourism, construction and building, electricity and water, and agriculture, all of which are central to the current and future prosperity of the region and its people.  EADB sees education as immensely important for the future of East Africa.

Some 70 youth delegates representing 40 political parties from nearly 40 African nations attended the forum, and discussed on the theme “How youths can play a role in exploring paths that suit their national conditions”.
　Song Tao, Minister of the International Department of the CPC Central Committee, attended the opening ceremony and delivered a keynote speech. Song Tao said the CPC and participating African political parties had laid great emphasis on youth engagement. He expressed the hope that Chinese and African youth, answering the call of the times, would contribute to the exploration of their national development paths, to the promotion of China-Africa friendship, and to the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.

　　Song Tao stated that the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics was the root cause of all achievements and progress that China had made. It’s a path that we uphold the leadership of the CPC, in light of our national conditions, put people’s interests first, adhere to the policy of reform and innovation, and pursue common development through opening-up, on which the CPC is willing to enhance mutual exchanges with African political parties, and plays the leading role of a political party in exploring the development path that suits its national conditions.



　　According to Marius Assoumou Ndong, Deputy Secretary General of the Gabonese Democratic Party and Secretary General of the Party’s Youth League, reform and opening-up, as one of China’s major achievements, was also an important channel to achieve the goal of building a community with a shared future for mankind. Gabon fully supports and endorses the open concept that aims at jointly building a peaceful world.

　　The 4th China-Africa Young Leaders Forum was an event within the framework of the CPC in Dialogue with World Political Parties High-level Meeting. During the two-day forum, delegates made recommendations for Chinese and African youth about how to play a role in exploring paths that suit their national conditions, how to better inherit and carry forward the traditional friendship between China and Africa in the new era, how to better strengthen exchanges between Chinese and African youth organizations, as well as how to better participate in and facilitate China-Africa cooperation and how to promote the building of a community of a shared future for China and Africa.

The Public Affairs Section of the Embassy of the United States of America is pleased to announce the Fulbright African Research Scholar Program (ARSP) for the 2019/2020 academic year.

The ARSP is administered for the U.S. Department of State by the Council for the International Exchange of Scholars (CIES), a division of the Institute of International Education.

PROGRAM INFORMATION:
Two categories of grants are offered in the ARSP:  research grants and program and curriculum development grants.

RESEARCH GRANTS:
Awards of 3 to 9 months are offered for university faculty or research institute professionals to conduct research in any academic discipline at a U.S. academic or research institution beginning no earlier than August 2019 and no later than March 2020.  Applicants must hold a doctorate or equivalent terminal degree in their fields.  Preference will be given to individuals who have at least three years of university teaching experience and a productive scholarly record.

PROGRAM AND CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT GRANTS:
Awards of 3 to 5 months are offered for university faculty or administrators to conduct research in any academic discipline at a U.S. academic or research institution beginning no earlier than August 2019 and no later than March 2020.  Proposals should be linked to professional duties and demonstrate how the scholar will use the knowledge gained to develop new courses, curricula, or other academic programs at the home institution.  These grants are designed for university faculty or administrators with less experience and who may not have had recent access to research or instructional developments in their disciplines.  A doctorate degree is not required, but applicants must hold a minimum of a master’s or equivalent graduate degree.

HIV/AIDS:
The ARSP includes a special group of grants for scholars with proposals in HIV/AIDS-related research. Scholars in all academic disciplines are invited to formulate proposals with an HIV/AIDS focus.  Candidates may apply either as research scholars or program and curriculum development scholars.

The Public Affairs Section of the Embassy of the United States of America invites eligible candidates to submit applications.  The applicant must declare the particular grant program for which he/she is applying (research grant or program and curriculum development grant) and should tailor his/her proposal to the appropriate program in the application form.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON ELIGIBILITY:
The application should include a detailed statement of three to five pages which describes the proposed project and the methodology to be employed.  If the project is highly technical and scientific in nature, the application should include an explanation for non-specialist readers who will be involved in reviewing the proposals.

A copy of the applicant’s most recent curriculum vita, list of publications, the scholar’s dates of availability and three current letters of reference/recommendation are also required.  If possible, at least one of the three required letters should be from an individual outside the applicant’s home institution, who can still comment on the candidate’s research skills and academic and scholarly experience.

There are no restrictions as to age, gender, faculty rank, or academic discipline for either type of ARSP grant.  Preference will be given to proposals that promote the spirit and goals of the Fulbright program – that is, to increase and enhance mutual understanding between the United States and African countries through interpersonal contact and the sharing of professional academic experience and expertise.

Applicants must have university teaching experience and a productive scholarly record.  Their research proposal must relate directly to their ongoing teaching and research responsibilities.  Scholars who have received a Fulbright grant for study, teaching, or research in the United States within the last five years are ineligible to apply.

Proposals involving doctoral dissertation research, postdoctoral research immediately following completion of a doctoral degree, or general professional travel, are ineligible.  Preference will be given to individuals who have had no experience or only limited experience in the United States.  Proposals for clinical medical research involving physician training, patient care and contact cannot be approved under the Fulbright Program.

Letters of invitation are strongly encouraged but not required.  Applicants are discouraged from requesting affiliation with an alma mater.  CIES will honor institutional affiliation preferences as far as possible.  Applicants unfamiliar with U.S. institutions may request that CIES identify suitable placements.

Applications must be submitted online using the Embark Visiting Scholar system, accessible athttps://iie.embark.com/apply/visitingscholars before July 15, 2018.

 Please note that unfortunately none of the ARSP grants accommodate accompanying family members.

If you have any questions related to the ARSP application process, please feel free to contact the U.S. Embassy Cultural Affairs Assistant Eyerusalem Mandefro (MandefroEM@state.gov).

MINDS offers scholarships to Africans who wish to pursue post-graduate studies within Africa, outside of their own countries. Through tailored leadership development activities, the MINDS Scholarship Program aims to nurture leaders who have a continental development mindset; leaders who will facilitate greater cohesion and cooperation between African countries.

MINDS scholarships are applicable to full-time studies of a one or two year Honors or Master's degree at one of the MINDS preferred institutions (listed below). MINDS does not prescribe the course to be studied.

The scholarship will cover some or all of the expenses below, depending on whether a partial or full scholarship is awarded:
Tuition,
 Accommodation and meals,
One return ticket per duration of studies,
A fixed stipend.
Individuals with a Pan-African outlook, demonstrated leadership ability and an excellent academic record who wish to study on the African continent, outside their home country are invited to apply for the scholarships.

Applying for a MINDS Scholarship? Here is some guidance:
Ensure that you meet ALL of the requirements set out and upload ALL of the required documents. Applications that do not meet requirements or for which all required documentation has not been provided are immediately disqualified. Don't get yourself disqualified because you're in a hurry to submit an application. Rather take the time to ensure that you meet the requirements and to gather all of the required documents before submitting an application.
We are looking for individuals with a Pan-African outlook, strong leadership potential and a track record of academic excellence. Your application must demonstrate these elements convincingly.
We encourage applicants to consider universities that are outside of South Africa. Most applications received to date have been for South African institutions and there are limited numbers that can be awarded to each university. This means that competition is stiffer for South African institutions.
There are two scholarships available for South African citizens wishing to study elsewhere in Africa.
We have set aside scholarships for studies that relate to Actuarial Sciences, Business Sciences and Accounting. If you wish to conduct such studies at any of the South African, Kenyan and Nigerian institutions that are on our preferred list, don't miss the opportunity to apply. Ensure that you meet the requirements before submitting an application.

The Mandela Institute for Development Studies (MINDS) is a continental institute that seeks to address the short, medium, and long-term development challenges in Africa in a holistic and comprehensive manner.

MINDS emerged out of the observation that development efforts in Africa have failed to meet expectations with respect to social, institutional and economic outcomes in comparison to other regions of the world such as Asia.

In most African states, it would appear that policy formulation and implementation could be greatly enhanced through the creation of an institution that is independent from government and political parties. Such an institution would be resourced to have capacity for formulating policy proposals for public debate in a non-partisan manner. Over time, governing political parties gradually lose the capacity and appetite for the robust debate that is necessary for the formulation of policies that are capable of underpinning the implementation of measures necessary for sustained development.

Most African institutions that are involved in policy formulation proposals tend to be official or public sector institutions. Two challenges arise from this ownership and dependency on public funding. The first challenge is how these institutions can, under these circumstances, take and maintain an independent and when necessary, challenging stance towards their paymasters. Secondly, if they are set up by the government of the day, then in all probability their staff will, from the very beginning, be chosen on the basis of their views being in alignment with the government of the day. In this situation, the value that derives from an institution that has a different perspective on issues is lost.

This justifies the establishment of a complementary and independent institution. The addition of an independent facet to policy formulation proposals and debate will introduce a point of view that should be value additive to public institutions work. The Mandela Institute for Development Studies (MINDS) established in 2010, emerged out of a simple and rather obvious observation that development efforts in Africa have hitherto failed to meet expectations with respect to social, institutional and economic outcomes in comparison to other regions. MINDS is an Africa-wide think tank which provides a forum for dialogue, information dissemination and networking, underpinned by rigorous research on the different elements of ‘Africanness’ in order to shape policy and practice on governance, economic development and the evolution of African institutions. It seeks to address the short, medium, and long-term development challenges in Africa.

The central hypothesis in setting up MINDS is that effective and sustainable development can only be achieved if development policies and practices are founded on the cultural heritage, value and knowledge systems and institutions of the people who are the subjects or beneficiaries of the development interventions.

As of 2019 the MINDS scholarship recipients were brought together at ALA in Johannesburg for a 4 day leadership development workshop

The central purpose of The Mandela Rhodes Foundation is to build exceptional leadership capacity in Africa (whilst also seeking to foster better reconciliation and entrepreneurship) through its various programmes and, to this end, aims to be the leading protagonist in Africa for such endeavours.

We do this in the firm belief that, in the words of our Founder and Patron, Mr Nelson Mandela, “…the work of The Mandela Rhodes Foundation will substantively contribute to a better life for the people of South Africa and further abroad on the African continent…”

The Mandela Rhodes programmes will develop leadership and vocational capacity across African society, to help the continent achieve success and prosperity and full equal participation in the global world. They will constitute ‘History At Work’, extracting from past legacies to help Africa succeed in the 21st century. The Scholarships Programme will be the main focus for the foreseeable future.

Mission
Whilst in pursuit of this vision, we recognise that we have a variety of stakeholders with different needs and expectations. The Mission that The Mandela Rhodes Foundation undertakes for each of these stakeholders is as follows;

For the donors, who empower and endow the MRF, we endeavour to provide an efficient and professionally managed and governed enterprise which serves as the vehicle and conduit to deliver the jointly-desired social impact indicated by our vision and purpose.
For the Scholars and other programme participants, we strive to support and build the leadership and intellectual capacity that is needed in order for the MRF to have the kind of social impact that we seek to attain in our vision.
For the communities, from whom we source our Scholars and for whom we ultimately seek to deliver social benefit, the MRF undertakes never to forget the purpose for which we exist and, in so doing, we pledge to work tirelessly and with accountability so as to maximise the impact that we seek to enable through those whom our programmes empower.
For our related charities and Foundations (e.g.: The Rhodes Trust, the other ‘Mandela’ Foundations), with whom we share common heritage, we strive to act collaboratively as needs be and in ways that mutually enhance our respective endeavours and build our collective reputation.
For the staff who work on delivering the outcomes of the MRF, we strive to offer an inspiring and rewarding opportunity for them to be key players in the delivery of that enabling work that is needed to bring the lofty objectives of our vision into being.

Aspire to be a Mandela Rhodes Scholar if you dream of being a leader; a leader in whose blend of character and intellect Africa will take pride.

Aspire to this if you believe you have within you the moral force of character and instinct to lead; and understand that leadership is more than personal ambition, it is also service, requiring the will and capacity to inspire and develop fellow human beings to their own excellence;

Aspire to this if you believe that the advancement of individual and social fulfillment, human rights, dignity, the achievement of fundamental freedoms, is among the highest of callings;

Aspire to this if you believe that hard work is essential, and you esteem the performance of public duties to be among the noblest of aims.

Aspire to be a Mandela Rhodes Scholar if you understand education to be both a gift and a tool for the advancement of human development, to the benefit of all.

Aspire to this if you value and pursue scholastic attainment, but understand that intellectual excellence is not to be seen in isolation from other qualities of character; that leaders require a roundedness of personality;

Aspire to this if you believe that in receiving an exceptional education, an individual embraces a responsibility to foster such opportunities for others;

Aspire to this if you believe that your own success might also make a difference to others.

Aspire to be a Mandela Rhodes Scholar if you believe in an entrepreneurial spirit to allow Africa to take with dignity its rightful place as an equal and competitive presence in the global world.

Aspire to this if you have the vigour to pursue this aim with integrity; and the energy to use your talents to the full, as exemplified by a fondness for and success in team pursuits beyond the confines of your professional career;

Aspire to this if you believe that individual human effort, innovation and  creativity will lead to the betterment of society and an effective contribution to the world;

Aspire to this if you love Africa and all of its peoples.

Aspire to be a Mandela Rhodes Scholar if you believe in reconciliation, freedom, peace and prosperity among all human beings, who should share equal citizenship and opportunities in this world.

Aspire to this if you believe in being part of creating a humane world in which all individuals and cultures enjoy equal respect; a world whose emergence will say a new order is born in which we are all each other’s keepers;

Aspire to this if you value truth, courage, devotion to duty, sympathy for and protection of the weak, kindliness, unselfishness and fellowship;

Aspire to be a Mandela Rhodes Scholar if you believe that the past, in all its imperfection, should be harnessed to benefit the present and the future.

Guiding Principles
Introduction
The Mandela Rhodes Foundation is a unique partnership seeking to close a circle of history for the benefit of current and future generations of Africans. It brings together the 20th century legacy of Leadership and Reconciliation embodied by Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, and Cecil John Rhodes’s 19th century legacy as it relates specifically to Education and Entrepreneurship.

The overarching mission of The Mandela Rhodes Foundation is to build exceptional leadership capacity in Africa, by providing excellent educational and training opportunities to individual Africans with leadership potential; as well as by creating over time a network of well-rounded leaders of talent, effectiveness and integrity across African society.

The Mandela Rhodes Scholarships are intended as a vehicle for the sustainable and practical expression of the aim to provide exceptional educational opportunities, develop a network of leaders, and thereby help to build leadership capacity in Africa.

The Scholarships programme will seek candidates who identify with the values set out by Mr. Mandela and Mr. Rhodes; as well as demonstrating the characteristics set out separately in the document: The Characteristics Sought in a Mandela Rhodes Scholar.

What follows is an expansion, intended in the first instance to provide clarity for members of the Mandela Rhodes Scholarships Selection Committees, on each of the four ‘legacy categories’ to which the Mandela Rhodes Scholarships programme is intended to give practical expression.

Leadership
By Leadership we mean the will and capacity to use one’s own personality and abilities to guide, inspire, and develop fellow human beings to achieve excellence in any area of endeavour. This leadership should be principled, strategic, and effective; it should carry moral authority and be visionary in pursuit of the advancement of individual and social fulfilment, human rights, human dignity, the achievement of equality and other fundamental freedoms. Personal success by a Scholar which does not translate into wider benefits for society does not in itself meet the goal of the Scholarship programme. Leadership could include, but does not necessarily presuppose, a career in the public sector.

Reconciliation
By Reconciliation we mean an embracing of human diversity, and a belief in a world in which all individuals and cultures enjoy equal rights and respect. This commitment to human reconciliation means seeking to make a contribution to freedom, peace and prosperity for all human beings, never to the exclusion of any category of humanity. It implies a generosity of spirit, and a willingness to harness an imperfect past to help develop a more just world.

Education
By Education we mean the pursuit of a high minimum standard of scholastic attainment, certainly sufficient to meet the requirements of the course envisaged by the Scholar. In tandem with this we seek understanding that academic achievement on its own is not sufficient to justify selection – this is what is meant by a blend of character and intellect. Further, we seek a thoughtful understanding of how education writ large – not just the education of the individual Scholar – can be a tool for the advancement of human development.

Entrepreneurship
By Entrepreneurship we mean a belief in the critical role played by individual human effort, hard work, innovation and creativity in leading to the betterment of society and Africa’s place in the world. Scholars are required to exhibit vigour and integrity, and the energy to use their talents to the full, in pursuit of their own career and beyond its confines. Entrepreneurship in this conception could include, but does not necessarily presuppose, a career in the private sector.

The Scholarship is open to citizens of all African countries
The Scholarship is for postgraduate study at South African universities or tertiary institutions
Full funding is for Honours (maximum one year) or Masters (up to a maximum of two years) or their equivalents (MBA’s excluded)
Any individual who will be between the ages of 19 and 30 years at the time of taking up the Scholarship may apply
Applicants must possess a first degree or its equivalent or must be in the process of completing one by 31 January 2019
Applicants should have a history of well above average academic results
Individuals that reflect in their character a commitment to the four principles of Education, Reconciliation, Leadership and Entrepreneurship
Applicants must be able to attend all compulsory elements of our leadership development programme. These activities can occur during the week or on weekends.
The Scholarship cannot be deferred once awarded. It must be taken up in the year which was applied for.

Terms and Conditions
1. General terms and conditions of the Scholarships programme
A Mandela Rhodes Scholarship enables a Scholar to study at a South African tertiary institution registered with the South African Council on Higher Education (and approved by the MRF) for an accredited postgraduate degree programme. The Scholarship is currently awarded for either a one year Honours or an up to two years Masters degree, or their academic equivalents.

Mandela Rhodes Scholars shall:

Adhere to the principles and goals of the Mandela Rhodes Scholarships programme.
Attend leadership workshops as offered by the Mandela Rhodes Scholarships programme, on dates to be advised. Attendance is a condition of accepting the Scholarship, unless there are exceptional circumstances agreed to by the MRF.
Be offered access to peer-mentoring (optional for the Scholar).
According to the current policy of the MRF, be younger than 30 years of age at the time of taking up the Scholarship; be in possession of a first degree; and be a citizen of an African country.
2. Conditions of tenure
The continued holding of the Scholarship is dependent upon the maintenance of evidence-based, high standards of work and conduct which, in the opinion of the Trustees, justifies the holding of the Scholarship.
Other scholarships may not be held in conjunction with a Mandela Rhodes Scholarship. If a Scholar is in doubt about what constitutes another scholarship – as opposed to awards or prizes, they should consult the Foundation.
This Scholarship is for full time study only and may not be held simultaneously with paying work that exceeds a maximum of 12 hours per week. In such cases the Foundation must be kept fully informed on the nature and terms of the additional work, and give its consent.
Furthermore, the continued holding of the Scholarship is dependent on the Scholar upholding the values, principles and standards of the MRF, as determined by the Trustees and/or the Foundation.
Where Scholars are in breach of such standards, values and principles for any reason the MRF may cease payments to and participation in the programme by the Scholar.
3. Financial scope of the Scholarship
The Scholarship covers the cost of a Scholar as follows:

Tuition and registration fees as set by the institution
A study materials allowance as set by the MRF
Accommodation and meal allowances as set by the MRF
A medical aid allowance as set by the MRF
Economy-class travel allowance for international Scholars only from the Scholar’s home to their institution at the beginning and back home at the end of their degree programme
Personal allowance
Scholars must note the following:
Allowances are paid twice a year, conditional on provision of proof of registration or acceptance, and on receipt of the stipulated progress report from the tertiary institution no later than two weeks after the start of the second semester.
Tuition and registration fees are paid directly to the tertiary institution, while all other allowances are administered according to the MRF’s policies for that year.
Any amount due to or owed by a student prior to their becoming a Mandela Rhodes Scholar, shall be the sole responsibility of the student, and the MRF will not become involved in any way.
4. Rebates
The MRF pays fees as set out above in clause B3, as invoiced to the Scholar by their institution. As a clear principle, where a Scholar receives a rebate, the MRF will not refund the Scholar the amount of the rebate.

5. Institutional transfers
A Scholar may not change their institution of study from that indicated on their application form unless explicitly approved by the MRF.

6. Interaction with donors
Specific donors underwrite some Mandela Rhodes Scholarships. Some donors wish to interact with Scholars and are invited to do so on the understanding that the Scholar may determine the level of interactions. Reasonable requests received in good time should be acceded to where possible, and should they be declined it is the responsibility of the Scholar to supply reasons on time. On taking up their Scholarships, Scholars will be informed of relevant details regarding their particular funder, if applicable.

7. Failure to comply with degree requirements
Should a Scholar fail to comply with the requirements for continued study in the course for which they are registered, financial support from the MRF will cease.

8. Requirements to supply personal updates
In accepting a Mandela Rhodes Scholarship, Scholars undertake to reply timeously and comprehensively each year, during their period in residence and thereafter, to a written request conveyed electronically to them by the MRF for an update of personal details. These details are required for the maintenance of an up-to-date database, and for use in the ‘feedback and update’ section of the MRF’s Yearbook and website.

9. Limitation of liability
The Mandela Rhodes Foundation will not take responsibility for bodily injury, sickness, accident or death of Mandela Rhodes Scholars. It is up to Mandela Rhodes Scholars to provide for their own insurance needs.",,"""Post-graduate (MA, Professional, PhD)""",2yrs-<4 yrs,2 years,"18-24,25-35",19-30,"10-50,51-100",51 in 2020,529 (in 2020),Foundation,$0,,"PHYSICAL ADDRESS:

Through this award, investigators receive support with their research and career development through programmes of Personal Development Planning (PDP) and mentorship.
PhD Programme

The  PhD Programme
The MCDC PhD programme offers support to candidates of high academic calibre who have demonstrated a strong commitment to research relevant to the prevention or control of malaria.

A rigorous procedure was used to select the most able African students to pursue PhD studies based in the African countries participating in the programme - Ghana, Malawi, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda. 18 PhD students were selected, and each allocated to one of the five African partner universities. the African partner Universities are: Kilimanjaro Christian Medical College, in Moshi, Tanzania,College of Medicine in Blantyre-Malawi, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Kumasi-Ghana, Makerere University in Kampala-Uganda and University of Dakar in Dakar-Senegal.

Students are registered for a PhD at one of the African institutions and are also linked to a European partner institution where they are co-supervised. Provision has also been made for students to spend up to one year in Europe.

What’s covered?
The four-year award covers the PhD stipend and tuition fees. Research project costs of up to a maximum of £50k are covered by the award, as well as accommodation costs for up to one year in a selected European institution.

All students are supported in a structured personal development planning programme to assist with the scientific and educational requirements of their PhD programme; as well as with their career development planning beyond their PhD. Once their PhD is completed students are invited to join the MCDC Investigator Programme and eligible to apply for the postdoctoral awards to support continued research in their own institution.

AIM
The aim of the Malaria Capacity Development Consortium (MCDC) Leadership Development Programme (LDP) is to strengthen the skills of MCDC scientists to lead and manage internationally competitive research groups.

Approach
The programme uses a series of facilitated interactions to strengthen the leadership skills of 13 African scientists over a 12 month period from September 2014 - August 2015. The group comprises a mix of established and experienced researchers as well as new, junior postdoctoral scientists, all from the MCDC network, jointly referred to as MCDC Investigators. An extended overview of the MCDC LDP is available here.

The MCDC LDP programme has been developed with Quilibra Consulting Ltd, who will support selected candidates, using a blended learning approach, to reach four key developmental stages:

LDP Pathway ‐ Key Step 1: ""Committed to Lead” – Focusing on: Self Awareness.
LDP Pathway ‐ Key Step 2: “Equipped to Lead” – Focusing on learning and developing essential skills now
LDP Pathway ‐ Key Step 3: ""Connect & Navigate” – Focusing on establishing and developing professional and collaborative / supportive relationships.
LDP Pathway ‐ Key Step 4: ""Ready to Deliver” – Focusing on leadership.
Further information on the LDP key stages and exchange trips.

To assist candidates in reaching their developmental goals, the programme is using a mix of one to one and group work; face to face, virtual learning, online and community interaction, facilitated and self‐led learning and short exchange trips with the aim of improving the way they lead, and the impact and results they can achieve.  The LDP will complement other activities that each participant is already undertaking as part of their career development and therefore targets the essential skills investigators need to master early in their professional careers as leaders in science. The programme takes in to account individual needs and capabilities whilst focussing on the core competences needed to effectively lead an internationally renowned programme or research team.",checked,"""Post-graduate (MA, Professional, PhD)""",4 yrs,4 years,NL,NL,10-50,12- 18,63,Foundation,$0,Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Institute; Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine; The London School of Tropical Medicine; University of Copenhagen.

​​The Mo Ibrahim Foundation itself has a mission of supporting African leadership, so I could see a strong argument for treating these as a group of scholarships.

MSFS MISSION: LEADERSHIP IN SERVICE TO THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY
The Master of Science in Foreign Service (MSFS) is a professional master’s degree in the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University. Its goal is to prepare women and men to be creative leaders in the public, private and non-profit sectors of international affairs. In keeping with the vision of the School’s founder, Father Edmund A. Walsh, S.J., MSFS seeks to instill in its students a commitment to service in the international community and an appreciation for the ethical dimension of international affairs.

For more about the School of Foreign Service see The Aims of the School of Foreign Service, November 25, 1919, by Father Edmund A. Walsh, S.J.

MSFS CORE VALUES: LEADERSHIP, CREATIVITY, ETHICS AND SERVICE
To achieve our mission, and flowing from Georgetown’s Jesuit tradition, MSFS is animated by four core values: Leadership, Creativity, Ethics, and Service.

At MSFS, we define leadership as the ability to work cooperatively with others to develop a vision, articulate concrete goals and strategies, and implement positive change. We are committed to providing opportunities for our students to develop and strengthen these skills both inside and outside the classroom, preparing them for the challenges they will confront in their careers. As practitioners in the field of international affairs, our graduates are equipped with the tools to lead effectively in today’s complex and diverse global society.

Creativity is the ability to think outside established paradigms and to solve problems innovatively. With new technologies, new actors, and new patterns of behavior on the international scene, MSFS graduates must be able to exercise their imagination. Our curriculum and co-curricular programming is designed to encourage and inspire students to approach every undertaking with creativity in both their personal and professional lives.

Ethics is the foundation for all of our coursework, programming, and professional development. We believe every student must have an understanding and appreciation of different moral frameworks and an ability to articulate competing goods, balance their merits, and choose among them. With this background in ethical reasoning, MSFS graduates are prepared to navigate the challenging multi-dimensional decisions that are the hallmark of a career in international affairs.

Service is a commitment to help others, especially the most vulnerable and disadvantaged populations, both in the local community and abroad. MSFS seeks to foster a passion for civic engagement and the pursuit of social justice in all its students, encouraging a life-long dedication to serving the greater, global community.",,"""Post-graduate (MA, Professional, PhD)""",2yrs-<4 yrs,2 year,,,,,,University,"$106,000",,"MASTER OF SCIENCE IN FOREIGN SERVICE PROGRAM

The programme awards scholarships to postgraduate students and staff from various African countries to study at one of the consortium partners.

The scholarships include travel costs, tuition fees and a living allowance of €600 per month for Master’s students and €900 per month for PhD students. Master’s exchanges will be for a period of up to 10 months and PhD exchanges will be for a period of up to 12 months.

TRECCAfrica programmes range across disciplines such as sustainable development, environmental management, renewable energy, food science and technology, natural resource assessment, climate and society, biotechnology, agro-ecology, soil physics, microbiology and veterinary medicine.

About Us
TreccAfrica (Transdisciplinary Training for Resource Efficiency and Climate Change Adaptation in Africa) will provide doctoral and master’s training to 80 postgraduate students in Africa at six leading African Universities to provide the next generation of academics and professionals who will be able to address an interlocking set of real challenges for Africa’s future development: climate change and resource depletion.

Africa’s position in this complex requires unique, transdisciplinary skills and competencies. It is a continent dominated by poverty, contributes relatively little to total greenhouse gasses and in recent years has become the focus of a new global scramble for primary resources as new players like China have entered the game.

It is generally accepted that Africa might well experience the most severe impacts of climate change and is the continent that is least prepared to handle these impacts. To be truly sustainable Africa will need to ensure that it uses its rich resource endowment responsibly to fund investments in human capacity and knowledge infrastructure that will sustain development after the primary resources have been depleted. This, in turn, will establish for Africa the kind of funding base needed to finance adaptations to climate change.

The skills and competencies in transdisciplinary research methodologies that TRECCAfrica students will acquire and the research network that they will comprise will be able to generate policy-relevant research that tracks resource flows, prices, the use of these resources and flows of resource rents. Such a network will incorporate the various research environments from the six partners involved into a sustainable partnership for climate change and resource efficiency, as co-supervision and staff mobility form part of the project.

Summary of Project

The project will address one of the world’s greatest environmental challenges: food security in the face of climate change, resource depletion and loss of forests, wildlife and environmental services.
Africa inherited inefficient and extractive resource regimes that led also to political exclusion and poverty.

Promoting new governance configurations that are inclusive and decentralised can, by contrast, lead to a virtuous cycle in which we can produce more wealth from less environmental resources for more people, and in ways that are much better adapted to achieve food security in the face of climate change.

Globally, the challenges of food insecurity within the context of climate change are inhibiting economic growth and human wellbeing, and these problems are expected to accelerate.

The food system is also changing as a result of complex and dynamic interactions of a range of socio-economic and environmental factors, including among others, urbanisation, concentration of production, vertical integration, deregulation and economic liberalisation.

As demand for food is expected to double in the next 25-50 years, food systems will be forced to adapt to mounting challenges that current research and global institutions, especially those in Africa are only starting to grasp.



Objectives of TRECCAFRICA II

This project intends to promote this adaptation by involving and educating young Africans proactively in the process of developing, understanding and scaling new approaches through ‘transdisciplinary’ research.

The project proposes to award 86 Masters and Doctoral scholarships and exchange opportunities to some of Africa’s brightest young minds, and a further 14 staff exchange opportunities to consortium members to enhance learning and joint research on this theme. In total, 100 individual mobility opportunities are therefore foreseen.

The European Union’s Intra-ACP academic mobility scheme promotes cooperation between higher education institutions (HEIs) and supports mobility in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) regions.

The programme is implemented and managed by the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) of the European Union.

The intra-ACP academic mobility scheme provides support to:

higher education institutions to set up inter-institutional cooperation partnerships between universities from different countries within the ACP regions;
individual students, researchers and university staff to spend a study / research / teaching period in one of the countries within the ACP regions.The Intra-ACP programme builds on the African Union’s Mwalimu Nyerere programme for Africa, granting additional funding, and setting up a similar scheme for the Caribbean and Pacific regions and is funded through the European Development Fund (EDF).",,"""Post-graduate (MA, Professional, PhD)""",1 yr-<2 yr,12 months,NL,NL,51-100,80,,Government,,"Open Society Foundation, African Technology Policy Studies Network",treccafrica@sun.ac.za,,Application_Form_en.doc (https://dl.airtable.com/zU1i06T2TMWQRSS39HCo_Application_Form_en.doc),,,,,,"Not really strong ""leadership"" language used there but they make references to ""bright young minds"" and their contribution to development.

The Zawadi Africa Education Fund is a program designed to provide scholarships to academically gifted girls from disadvantaged backgrounds from Africa to pursue higher education in the U.S.A, Uganda, Ghana, South Africa and Kenya.

The Zawadi Africa Education Fund is based on the highly successful Kennedy/Mboya Student airlifts of the 1960s, through a partnership with individuals and institutions with an interest.

We are a catalyst for accelerating the growth of women leaders. We believe in the power of women. Zawadi Africa was formed with the belief that with a world class education, young African women will be able to return to their home countries empowered and equipped with the skills needed to make significant impact in their communities.

The Zawadi Africa Education Fund was founded in 2002 by Dr Susan Mboya, and is based on the highly successful Kennedy-Mboya Africa Student Airlifts Program
Zawadi Africa Education Fund is a leadership development program that provides university scholarships and leadership development and life skills training to academically gifted but financially disadvantaged African girls, with the objective of developing a pipeline of young African women leaders.

Zawadi Africa was formed with the belief that together with a world class education and the right character development, these young African women will be able to return to their home countries empowered and equipped with the skills needed to make significant, positive impact in their communities in a continent where traditionally women have not had a voice in the development of their community.

The Zawadi Africa Education Fund was founded in 2002 by Dr Susan Mboya, and is based on the highly successful Kennedy-Mboya Africa Student Airlifts Program of the 1960’s, pioneered by Tom Mboya, (Dr. Mboya’ s father), and President John F. Kennedy.

The Kennedy/Mboya airlifts educated over 1000 bright young East Africans who went on to become Africa’s post-independence leaders. They include, among their alumni, the late Professor Wangari Maathai (Nobel Peace Prize Laureate), and Barack Obama Sr., Father of President Barack Obama. Zawadi Africa Education Fund is a 501 (c) 3 registered in the US.

To empower African women to participate in the development of the continent through education and self determination.

The Africa needs to localize and own the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), for instance, and mobilize resources internally and externally towards their attainment and towards the construction of a continent Beyond Aid with a youth-centered approach.

The youths have always felt voiceless and inadequate, thus don’t take initiatives. It was also evident that some of the information gotten from some of the religious leaders is misleading and a majority of the ones who fall victim are the youths. The discussion also realized that youth lacked mentors. It was a good platform that saw all the youths identifying at least one opportunity that they best fit in. The facilitators on their presentations were able to bring out the clear picture of the different issues.

This identified the need of youths having an umbrella of interfaith, youth-led organizations where the youth get their own platform and space to have more dialogue on key priority issues such as Insecurity, Corruption, Radicalization, Poverty and Illiteracy in order to eliminate negative prejudice and stereotypes. This points to a momentous need for a multi-partner strategy towards peripheral issues that impact peace and security, a major program among interfaith organizations.

Different Cooperation Circles realized that they had somehow a common mandate, which is creating and enhancing peace in the community. Though differently, all the circles have peace initiatives and outreach programs that educate the community on the importance of peaceful co existence. They learnt how they can work together with other Cooperation Circles in order to really make their individual and collective Cooperation Circle impact evident. Notably, the Cooperation Circles incorporate people from different religious backgrounds and they have been able to cooperate around projects within both formal and informal structures.

Saturday saw the convergence of the Cooperation Circles to put together the deliberations of the previous meeting and come up with a concrete, youth-led interfaith program for the URI Cooperation Circles in Kenya.

Africa is the world’s ‘youngest’ continent. Around 70 per cent of the population of sub-Saharan Africa is under the age of 30. Young people are key actors in shaping the continent’s sustainable political, social, economic and environmental development. Until now, the majority of young men and women have not had access to high-quality skills-based (vocational) training or employment to make a living and have been excluded from social and economic participation.

In their Agenda 2063, the Member States of the African Union (AU) set themselves the goal of creating better access to education, training and capacity development, employment and economic opportunities, and to recreational and cultural activities for Africa’s young people.

Education-based youth exchanges and volunteer services can help young people in broadening their personal horizons and acquiring life and employment-related skills. Youth exchange in the context of education for sustainable development, coupled with the goal of promoting youth civic engagement, provides an opportunity for young people to participate in sustainable development processes. However, exchange between young Africans and Germans often takes place in contexts of structural and economic inequality. So far young Africans have had few opportunities to gain experience through mobility, exchange or volunteer programmes in Germany or other African countries.

Dialogue and strategies for broad-based youth exchange and volunteer programmes that promote skills are still in their infancy in Africa. Conditions are not yet conducive for African partners and young people to play an equal role in shaping African-German youth exchange and volunteer programmes for sustainable development.

Objective
Conditions have improved for African partners and young people to play an equal role in shaping African-German youth exchange and volunteer programmes in the context of sustainable development.

Approach
The African-German Youth Initiative (AGYI) is being implemented in Germany and in African countries. Engagement Global is coordinating the development of the Initiative, which will enable youth exchange programmes between African countries and Germany to take place in a spirit of partnership. On behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), GIZ helps boost resources, capability and performance within partner structures. The project, based in Addis Ababa, operates at a pan-African level but will initially be implemented in the three pilot countries of Benin, South Africa, Tanzania. It is aligned with the AU’s Agenda 2063, the African Youth Charter (2006), the African Youth Decade, 2009-2018 Plan of Action (DPoA), and the national youth strategies of the pilot countries.

The project’s advisory services reinforce the technical skills and the planning and management capacities of the AUC’s Department of Human Resources, Science and Technology and of the three civil society organisations responsible for implementation in the pilot countries.

The project operates in three interrelated fields of activity:

Extending the offer of pan-African volunteer services and youth exchange programmes that promote skills development.
Strengthening technical skills together with planning and management capacities in the implementing organisations in the three pilot countries in order to support African-German, as well as trilateral and multilateral volunteer and youth exchange programmes that promote skills development, and to encourage participation and networking.
Networking between African and German partners for volunteer services and youth exchange.
Through youth exchange programmes, volunteer services and alumni activities with a focus on development policy, AGYI supports young men and women in realising their potential and in participating in social and political development processes.

Another focus is on promoting innovative ideas for exchange, volunteer services and social engagement. A recently established innovation fund will provide alumni, sending organisations and other stakeholders with the opportunity to implement creative approaches. The most effective learning experiences will be disseminated at pan-African level.",checked,checked,,https://www.giz.de/en/worldwide/43431.html,German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),Addis Ababa,Ethiopia,short-term program,,,"short-term program,conference or meeting",checked,checked,"Context

AYLS370,New Generation of Academic Program (nGAP),2015,South Africa,,"The New Generation of Academics Programme (nGAP) is a prestigious programme under the Department of Higher Education and Training (the Department) which involves the recruitment of highly capable scholars as new academics. The recruitment of these academics is based on carefully designed and balanced equity considerations and in light of the disciplinary areas of greatest need in the higher education system. The nGAP is currently the biggest programme within the Staffing South Africa’s Universities Framework (SSAUF), a university staff development component under the University Capacity Development Programme (UCDP).
The UCDP is an integrated, people-focused and transformative programme designed to address capacity development at all levels and areas (research, teaching and curriculum/programme development) with a view to address access and success in South Africa’s public universities. The UCDP is made up of 3 core components, namely: student development, staff development, and programme/curriculum development. The programme operates at the nexus of quality, equity and success in universities.
The nGAP is implemented in partnership with all 26 public universities in South Africa. The programme was introduced in 2015 and so far a total of 373 posts (125 in 2015, 79 in 2016, 58 in 2017 and 111 in 2018) have been allocated to universities.
The most important features of the programme are that successful applicants are appointed into permanent posts firmly factored into long-term staffing plans right from the outset, and appointments are governed by contracts which clearly spell out the expectations, obligations, roles and responsibilities of the employing university and of the newly appointed academic.
The programme is recurrent, and successive cohorts of nGAP appointees are taken on at intervals that are determined by fund availability. The number of posts that are made available, and the intervals between successive cohorts, are determined by the ability of the Department to source funding for successive cohorts.
The nGAP covers a six year period for each cohort taken onto the programme, covering a 3-year development programme plus 3 years induction thereafter. The nGAP is structured as follows:
a Development Programme of 3 years duration (with the possibility of the programme being tailored to meet the needs of individuals);
three years induction after successful completion of the Development Programme; and
continuing permanent employment at the appointing institution thereafter.",,,,http://www.ssauf.dhet.gov.za/ngap.html,,,South Africa,scholarship or grant,,,short-term program,,checked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,370,,

Inspiring the next generation to be value based leaders through leadership development and community engagement. Connecting with people (partners, donors, education community) of like mind who are commitment to the same vision.

Since the inception of Make A Difference Leadership Foundation in 2003, Founder and Chairman, Francois Pienaar has had an inspiring vision to provide educational access to deserving scholars with leadership potential (but who face economic and other barriers) through an individualised and personal approach. Therefore, MAD Leadership Foundation focuses on the whole individual, ensuring that our scholarship recipients not only succeed academically but manifest personal success and positive social engagement traits.

Through the comprehensive, personal and long-term support we offer our scholars through our Scholarship Programme, we develop an alumni of MAD Leadership Foundation Fellows who will invest back into South Africa and who will be a powerful force for positive change in their unique way and leaders in their own right. We have set an ambitious goal of funding 1000 scholars through our programme, we hope to achieve this through strong partnerships with corporates who support our fundraising events, partner with us in funding scholarships for individual scholars or by sponsoring specific elements of our programme",,,,https://madleadership.org/,,,South Africa,scholarship or grant,,,,,checked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In many African communities, girls are socialised to be submissive and unquestioning. This undermines their participation in the classroom and ultimately affects their performance in national examinations. However, when girls are empowered to speak up for themselves, they can overcome gender-based constraints, especially those imposed by cultural tradition.

FAWE believes that for meaningful transformation of gender relations, girls must participate in efforts to eliminate the discrimination and inequalities they face within their schools and communities. One of our flagship models is the innovative Tuseme [Let Us Speak Out] empowerment programme which uses theatre-for-development techniques to address concerns that hinder the social and academic development of girls. Tuseme trains girls to identify and understand the problems that affect them, articulate these problems and take action to solve them. Through drama, song and creative arts, girls learn negotiation skills, how to speak out, self-confidence, decision-making and leadership skills.

Tuseme was initiated at the University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in 1996 and enhanced by FAWE with gender-in-education and life skills components. The model has been introduced in Burkina Faso, Chad, Ethiopia, The Gambia, Guinea, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

Over 80,000 students have benefited from FAWE’s Tuseme model since 1996",checked,,Added Org,http://fawe.org/our-programmes/interventions/tuseme-youth-empowerment/,"Mastercard Foundation, The David and Lucile Packard Foundation, The Rockerfeller Foundation, Rockerfeller Philanthropy Advisors Inc, The Global Fund for Women Inc, Intel Foundation, Africa Women's Development Fund",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AYLS469,Girls Power Initative Nigeria,1993,Nigeria,,"The girlchild is first vulnerable as a child and this is increased being amongst the marginalised gender in the society. For a change in this narrative and the emancipation of the female gender from being relegated, voiceless, ignorant, and unhealthy girls are to be ‘caught young’ to drive this transformation. It was on this count GPI was formed. In Nigeria, adolescent girls are disproportionately vulnerable to HIV, unwanted pregnancies, trafficking, sexual and reproductive health challenges, no access to menstrual pad, various forms of social vices and lack of information on sexuality. They are socialised not to have a voice for themselves, not even to think to take decisions on their personal lives. GPI is driven towards training girls for an empowered womanhood – to be one who can think, make decisions, and take actions for oneself and on behalf of others. Girls in GPI’s training are armed with the strategies, skills, and self-esteem they need to negotiate their adolescent years in good health. GPI started as a gender geared life-skills education course for 16 girls, including the daughters of founders Grace Osakue and Bene Madunagu in 1994, but interactions with the pioneer girls showed their interest were on relationships, sexuality – this led to the inclusion of comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) to the GPI program with the girls contributing to the content of the curriculum which has been updated over the years. GPI fills the gaps left by standard school curricula by giving girls vital information about their bodies, their rights, and their responsibilities. These lessons help empower girls to take control of their reproductive and sexual lives and realize their full potential as individuals. Every girl who has passed through the GPI programme is a girl with a difference. This is often commented by those who have met them for they are assertive, articulate, and informed. The GPI Adolescent Girls Empowerment Program is the core of GPI Programming  It is a 3 year Weekly Safe Space Meeting for adolescent girls aged 10 -18 years (commonly referred to as Centre Meeting) where girls are geared from a gender perspective to be self-reliant and catalyst for social change and development. The Safe Space Lessons are set up in three levels and girls progress from level one to level three in age-stratified groups with non-judgemental and factual trainings on",checked,checked,board missing,https://gpinigeria.org/donation/girls-empowerment/,USAID; UN Women; Internation Women's health Coalition,Benin City,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
