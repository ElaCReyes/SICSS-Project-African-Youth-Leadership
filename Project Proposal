How do African Youth Leadership Organizations describe and conceive of leadership?

Why is your group project important? 
Since 2000 there has been a notable growth in the prevalence of organizations that position themselves as "youth leadership" training programs. These programs include some high profile examples like the Oprah Whinfrey Leadership Academy, the African Leadership Academy and the U.S. State Department's Young African Leaders Initative. Despite the substantial investments in youth leadership development on the African continent, there has been very limited mapping of the sector. Core concepts like 'leadership' and 'development' are largely unspecified. This project aims to contribute to a more thorough descriptive analysis of the field in order to inform and support further research in this field.
What are your hypotheses? 
Ho: there are discernable patterns in youth leadership program's official aims, mission and objectives.
