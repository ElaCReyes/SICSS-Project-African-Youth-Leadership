The 1st African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) convened from 26th - 27th
October, 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, on the theme “African Youth Responses to Climate
Change and Food Security, Action from the Frontline.” The conference was organized by Africa
Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) in partnership with Africa Climate Policy Center
(ACPC), New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), Pan African Climate Justice
Alliance (PACJA) and Zimbabwe United Nations Association (ZUNA).
100 youths selected across Africa in the conference addressing the thematic strands of Youth in
Agribusiness; Climate Change and Development in Africa; Sustainable Agriculture and Food
Security; Green Economy and Technology Transfer; Climate Justice and Human Rights; and
Climate Change and Disaster risk reduction participated in this first edition of the African Youth
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC). This came at a time when Africa as a continent
continues to bear the biggest brunt of climate change due to low resilience and weak capacities,
with the youth despite their huge numbers and innovativeness among the vulnerable alongside
women. Despite the odds, they have been actively engaged in adaptation and mitigation




                                                                   O
initiatives that improve their communities’ resilience to climate change.
The conference therefore provided a platform for the African youths to interact and share best
practices. Five flagship projects were selected to be used as case studies by African Youths in
starting their own projects depending on transferability. The conference also saw the drafting of




                                                M
African youth position for COP 21 which was handed over to African Group of Negotiators at the
fifth Climate Change and Development in Africa Conference (CCDA V).

(AfriYOCC-2016)

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the environmental challenge of climate
change is already modifying Africa’s economies and livelihoods, health, social structure,
infrastructure and natural systems. Over the years, African youth have proved their potential in
both promoting and implementing climate change adaptation projects in their communities.
Their innovations have continually been adopted in responding to climate change impacts. This
is despite various challenges that include low capacity and education, high rates of poverty and
lack of financial resources. At the same time, African youth have been minimally represented in
the respective country policy processes as well as during the UNFCCC climate change
negotiations. Above 50% of the African population are the youth. This justifies the urgent need
for youth capacity development to respond to climate change and inclusion as key stakeholders
in policy process and negotiations. AYICC aims to spearhead new innovations, look into new
systems of success to share with policy and decision-makers, and generally aim to improve on
the current system which is causing long-term and irreversible degradation to our livelihoods –
as the leading youth organization on climate change in Africa.



                                                                    O
In cognizance of the role and potential of the African youth in climate change mitigation and
adaptation and overall sustainable development trajectory, the second African Youth




                                                 M
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC), shall be held in Nairobi, Kenya on 10th to 13th
October, 2016 as AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its formation in 2006 during the
second Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12. Building on the success of the first




                                               E
edition of conference, AfriYOCC shall provide an avenue for African youths to showcase their
climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, projects and initiatives. Best practices
arising from the various AYICC country chapters shall be developed to an African youth




                                    D
climate change adaptation and mitigation best practices database and handbook. The
meeting will dilate on the current post 2015 development agenda and the role of young
people in championing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in
Africa.

The delegates shall have an opportunity to visit ongoing Climate Change adaptation and
agribusiness projects in Kenya for hands-on skills and knowledge replicable in their countries.
Consequently, it shall boost the skills and capacities of African youths to substantially contribute
to the process leading towards and during COP 22. Through partnership with both
Governmental and Non-governmental agencies, the conference shall not only negotiate for
more youth representation in the respective country policy processes towards the forthcoming
CoPs and country specific policies, but also provide learning and engagement opportunities for
African youths. This will greatly enhance their current capacity and potential to actively
participate in both national and international platforms for policy formulation and implementation.
The conference will also provide a platform to re-assess the current position of our negotiators
and create awareness about the critical role young people should play in shifting agendas in the
forthcoming Conference of Parties in Marrakech come November 2016. While a 4 day gathering

issues affecting their livelihoods.

African youth have for long been side-lined to the periphery of the substantive civic and policy
issues facing the continent. However, the worst affected are the rural based youths and those
residing in farming communities, peri-urban areas and those from conflict and post conflict
countries. This has resulted in youths from these marginalized communities having no
knowledge and information on the basic climate change science and adaptation and mitigation
mechanisms. The good news though is that there is capacity amongst many young people who
are already in the circles of upcoming academia, policy specialists, lawyers, journalists and
scientists’ alike. These capacities need to be strengthened and skills shared amongst the wider
group of young people on the continent so that best practices are disseminated and resources
are expanded.

While it is an undeniable fact that climate change is affecting all regions globally, especially in
developing countries, the adverse effects in the future is likely to increase if the Paris agreement
is not ratified and effectuated by all parties. And even though a deal was achieved during
COP21 in Paris, the impacts of climate change will definitely continue into the future. This
suggests that young people will have to not just understand what climate change is and how it is




                                                                      O
affecting our world, opportunities that exists within, but most importantly, participate actively into
finding amicable solutions. Young people of Africa have therefore considered it an inherent
imperative to contribute to their future by organizing the 2nd African Youth Conference on
Climate Change in October 2016 under the theme, ‘Making Climate Finance work for




                                                  M
African Youth.’


2.1 CONFERENCE STRATEGY




                                                E
The conference program shall be based on exploring mechanisms to finance climate adaptation
and mitigation through Innovations in agriculture, technology and other sectors. It shall be




                                     D
highly interactive with unique workshop-style design that enables participants to develop their
potential through practical experience. Participants will divide to participate in thematic
workshops and come up with an African Youth position paper and concrete activities to be
included in the African Youth Strategy on Climate Change.

The delegates shall be engaged in pre-conference activities that shall include and not limited to,
mapping of youth climate change and/or mitigation projects within the conference key focus
areas for selection as best practice and include in the African youth climate change adaptation
and mitigation best practices database and handbook and aggressively fundraise towards their
participation and a successful workshop. The conference shall critically examine the various
country positions and the overall continents positions of the African Group of Negotiators, their
achievements and potentials towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It shall
examine the youth voices in these positions and further develop African youth position for
COP22.

We expect 200 youth leaders to participate in this conference. The conference is convened by
the AYICC continental secretariat in collaboration with AYICC Kenya chapter and the member

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is an umbrella youth network of African
based youth organizations, university groups, rural youth groups, schools, and individuals
working on climate change and sustainable development issues. It aims at developing capacity
and strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent need to take action
against the impacts of climate change for both present and future generations.

The initiative (always referred to as the movement) was conceived in Nairobi Kenya 10 years
ago, during the second Conference of Youth (COY2) preceding the 12th Conference of Parties
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC - COP12). The
main reason for its founding was to ensure the inclusion, and active participation of youths from
the south, and specifically Africa, in the international climate change negotiations. This was
needed as the youth are more than half the African population and are most affected by climate
change impacts. They also got massive potential to support the continent to take action on
global warming.

During its formation, it comprised of 8 country chapters and current has grown to 45 country
chapters with over 20,000 members across Africa and the Diaspora. This initiative has provided




                                                                  O
a platform for knowledge, ideas and experiences sharing. It is also an avenue for development
of skills and strategies on youth action on climate change mitigation and adaptation in the
African continent. AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a
platform for them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the




                                               M
UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others.

Since its inception, we have worked in partnership with international youth movements and have




                                             E
played a great role in the establishment of the International Youth Climate Movement whose
youth member organizations are now officially acknowledged by the UNFCCC as the YOUNGO
(Youth NGOs involved in the climate change negotiations process). Since COY2 in Nairobi, it




                                   D
has had youth delegates’ representation in all COP meetings.

In addition to the above, we have had landmark successes that include:
     A reach out programme for a children’s home (Watoto Wema in Ruai) and School
        climate change education program run in selected schools in Kenya.
     Leadership and mentorship programmes especially on volunteerism.
     Community development projects particularly on clean energy (energy saving stoves for
        rural folks)
     Capacity development of youth on agribusiness
     Advocacy campaigns e.g. lobbied for lanes to be set aside along the major highways for
        non-motorised transport especially for cyclists.
     Policy engagements i.e. contributing to the climate change bill 2012,as stakeholders
     Youth Caravan from Kenya to Durban during COP 17

African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) www.ayicc.net is a continental youth network that was conceived in 2006 in Nairobi Kenya, during the
Conference of Youth held just before the UNFCCC COP12. This initiative has continued to link, and share knowledge, ideas, experiences, skills and strategies
on youth action around the continent on climate change, its mitigation and adaptation and sustainable development. In 2009, AYICC was granted observer
status to the African Minister Conference on Environment (AMCEN). AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a platform for
them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the Conference of Parties of UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others. AYICC
currently operates in over 45 African countries with over 20,000 members.

In response, to the call by AU Heads of Sates and Government to establish the CAHOSCC Youth Programme on Climate Change (CYPCC),

Founding Opportunities


AYICC Founding Opportunities

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the
environmental challenge of climate change will ultimately modify Africa's economies and livelihoods, health, social structure, infrastructure and natural
systems. To date little has been done to empower, capacitate and mobilise youth, particularly in Africa to address global environmental challenges such as
climate change. facebook d o w n ~ To remedy this, an initial step has been the formation of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC).

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change was formed partially in response to the poor representation of young Africans at the International Youth
Summit on Climate Change (November 24-28, 2005), which was held in conjunction with the United Nation's Climate Change Conference (November 28-
December 10, 2005) in Montreal , Canada. The overall mission of AYICC is to ensure that African youth are equipped toparticipate in future UNFCCC
meetings and other global initiatives for sustainable solutions to environmental degradation and climate change.

In order to ensure a strong youth presence in climate change dialogue and fora, there is a need for AYICC to ensure youth representation from various parts
of Africa. This will enable Africa's youth to engage with the global youth movement, governments and NGO's in a more coordinated and sustained manner.
The long term goal is to ensure sustainable and systematic global youth action, with special emphasis on African youth on the issue of climate change.

Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any financial assistance. The planning committee members have
volunteered their time and their contributions. However, in order to make this vision a reality we need to become a financially viable organisation. For this
reason, we would like to request your financial assistance in getting this vision off the ground.•

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE OPENING FORUM OF THE SEVENTH AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FORUM, 12TH OCTOBER

2010: Ms. Esther Agbarakwe, Nigeria




The Chair,

Climate Change poses significant challenges to future generations. As youth we have a stake in this future; it is our future.




                                                                                                                 O
As the 7th African Development Forum, we have indeed come of age, we are no longer in our childhood stages of determining sustainable development - the
time of maturity has arrived. This year is marked as the International Year of Youth and now, more than ever before, the youth are taking a stand. More than
anyone else, we, the Youth, face unprecedented challenges as a result of global climate change. We also share the responsibility of addressing ii. As a group,
we are key moral stakeholders in the international processes treating the most important challenge of our generation. As it is our future, we will be
disproportionately affected by the catastrophic impacts of climate change.

Advocacy and Behavior Change: II is critical for present and future leaders to collaborate on finding solutions. The need for cultural transformation in our time




                                                                              M
is stronger than ever. This transformation - that enables us to shift towards a more sustainable world - should be an organic process, guided by principles of
compassion, integrity and justice. We need to pragmatically rethink our behavioral patterns, to enable a paradigm shift that is based on an ongoing process of
action, reflection and meaningful participation. Awareness, education and empowerment are fundamental prerequisites to enabling this process, and the youth
are energetic and passionate about holding governments and all relevant stakeholders involved accountable for their actions. We are equal partners in this
process and commit ourselves fully to achieving the objectives as decided by this Forum.




                                                                            E
Contrary to what is believed; young people play a dynamic role in framing and implementing policies. So their role goes beyond advocacy. From an advocacy
perspective, young people are involved in songs and stories which spread awareness in local languages. Of course we understand the importance and
relevance of this because 70% of Africa is based in rural areas and the term Climate Change is foreign, Young people are finding ways of using words in local
languages to translate the message across.




                                                           D
It is time to shift the balance of decision-making towards the generation that will have to manage this unwanted inheritance, to make political and economic
decisions that can span a generation, and to enable real inter-generational and inter-cultural dialogue about climate change to be realized in institutions where
the youth generation can learn.

However at the same time a range of social learning and marketing approaches need to be developed to address the gap between classroom education styles
and education that stimulates real action. This gap prevents the cultural shift from token awareness to personal action and reaction.

Education: In relation to climate change, African Governments should begin at inception to mainstream youth voices and perceptions. This is particularly
important because climate change projections indicate that effects will begin to be most felt in the next 20-30 years - young people should begin to be part of
the solution so that they will be able to cope when disaster calls. Involving them in this programme will ensure that those who will be affected will have direct
knowledge of the challenges and strategies for coping as well as the ability to mobilize communities to respond to and prepare for the impact of climate change
and natural disasters.

Governments must give credence to the higher learning education system in Africa in particular the increased accent on improvement of research and
innovation on climate change specifically highlighting on policy and reform, the programmes, pedagogy and teaching tools. This will enhance an equipped pool
of intellectual capital among the young people on climate change issues who will replicate this to the various organizations and networks that they are part of.

Al government level, during the last Conference of the Parties (COP), ii was pleasing to see that many African delegations included youth and gave them a role
to play. Furthermore, many youth who were involved in COP 15 deliberations have been interacting with their various governments and engaging in processes
and procedures that are related to Climate change policy. There is an understanding that more needs to be done, and at this forum, I urge you to engage young
people who knock on your doors asking to be involved.

Youth and youth based NGOs play a major role either in strengthening local capacity to cope or by supporting local action. Already, groups such as the Nigerian
Youth Coalition and the African youth Climate Initiative-Kenya have established school climate clubs, which are creative ways to engage young people; these
initiatives should be mainstreamed into education systems. Young people in this governance process are important because successful adaptation requires a
host of innovative measures developed with vulnerable communities to improve their present and future livelihoods. Young people are vibrant and are able to
access places that many governmental institutions fail to access. As the majority of the population and Africa's future, it is important to include them in this
impending crisis that is Climate Change.

Already, this conference calls for integrated approaches to enable African countries to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change. There is a dire need
to have a clearer understanding of the potential calamities that climate change can bring and to start the discourse on how best to stave off the worst impacts.
There is already an understanding that

Climate Change is not a localized problem but transcends national borders, hence the need for co-operation of Intergovernmental agencies but also to include
those young and vulnerable people.

Conclusion :
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYL0S23_Bridge2Rwanda","No longer can climate change be seen as merely an environmental problem or an energy challenge. It is a combination of both, which needs the involvement of
young people to preserve the environment and enter into green energy careers.

It's important for all of us to recognize that sustainable development isn't just a catch phrase - people all over the continent are taking it into their own hands. A
couple days ago over 300 community events took place in nearly every country on the continent of Africa, and more than 7000 globally as part of the Global
Work Party on 10/10/10.

Everywhere in the wortd, people planted trees, cultivated community gardens, installed solar panels, made buildings more efficient and implemented thousands
of other grassroots solutions to the climate crisis. We got to work everywhere in the world, but we need you, leaders, to get to work, too.

Thank you and God bless

                                             M
increasingly becoming the centre of discussion.


The world today is home to the largest generation of young people in history and
their energy, creativity, and innovation, when harnessed properly, will accelerate




                                           E
sustainable solutions to the global crisis. Youth have a pivotal role to play in the
implementation of ACE which consists of six elements namely: education,
training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and
international cooperation.




                             D
At COP25, the Intergenerational Inquiry which is a highlight event of Young and
Future Generations Day and like every year provided a platform for youth and
decision-makers to discuss how young people can enhance the implementation
of the Paris Agreement. This platform was attended by the Executive Secretary of
the UNFCCC and provided an opportunity for young people to share the
outcome on the Conference of Youth (COY 15) to the secretariat.


The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) has continued to
empower and mobilize young people at COP through our side events and
exhibitions. Through an exhibition at COP 25, AYICC was able to showcase the
actions and contributions of African youth in the fight against climate change.
Such actions include ecological restorations, renewable energy promotion, and
local conference of youth hosted by our national chapters.


AYICC's greatest concern however, is with regards to the low representation of
African youth at the UNFCCC sessions. There are many contributing factors which
includes lack of funding, inability to assess accreditations and visas. As the first
step in addressing this, we will continue to encourage African countries to make
conscious efforts to include youth delegates in their official delegations for COPs.
We also call on development partners and stakeholders who are interested in
youth development to reach out with their support to AYICC to enhance African
youth participation in this important global process.

Climate Change


• Campaigns and Advocacy
 The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is widely known for our
 incessant campaigns and research-based advocacy on environmental and
 climate change topics. Since 2006 AYICC has been consistent with its
 campaigns impressing on African governments and international community
 alike to deliver on their commitment under the United Nations Framework
 Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) .



• Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)
 Climate change education, training, and awareness creation have been the
 central focus of AYICC targeting youth and vulnerable communities. We do
 this through workshops, conferences, and webinars leveraging on our robust
 online presence. Through our Flagship program; the African Youth Conference
 on Climate Change (AFRIYOCC) we are able to provide a platform for




                                                                     O
 exchange of ideas and sharing of knowledge and best practices among young
 African thereby feeding into article 6 of the climate change convention and
 article 12 of the Paris Agreement.



• Tree planting and Ecological restoration



                                         M
 Trees contribute to their environment by providing oxygen, improving air
 quality, climate amelioration, conserving water, preserving soil, and




                                       E
 supporting wildlife. Beyond the campaigns and advocacies, our member
 organizations embark on tree planting and reforestation activities including
 mangrove restoration along the coast.




                         D
• Renewable energy promotion
 With the increasing demand for energy for industrial and economic
 development, AYICC member organizations in different countries are
 promoting renewable energy access to isolated off-grid communities. AYICC
 believes that Youth-led renewable energy enterprises are a viable means of
 achieving sustainable development, as they promote technologies that are
 less harmful to the global environs while at the same time providing
 sustainable income-generating opportunities for youth .



• Youth in Agribusiness
 AYICC sees agriculture as an essential driver of economic development and an
 area of great opportunity for young people in Africa. The challenge, however,
 is that the growing youth population does not see agriculture as a profitable
 opportunity due to their lack of insight into the opportunities that exist within
 the agriculture value chain. Through our member organizations who are youth
 farmers themselves, AYICC has adopted various strategies including outreach
 to schools and communities, exhibitions and youth agricultural festivals as
 well as institution of award schemes for best youth farmers as a way to raise
 interest and awareness on the opportunities that exist within this sector.



• Recycling
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYL0S23_Bridge2Rwanda","                            Over recent years, the world has witnessed an increasing level of waste
                            products as a by-product of the increasing level of population, affluence, and
                            technological advancement in a given environment or society. In Africa we
                            have witnessed increasing level of pollution from plastic, car tires, bottles
                            among others and this has generated innovative thinking among young
                            people to provide a sustainable solution. Over the years, AYICC members have
                            redefined waste as a resource for sustainable development and through
                            various recycling initiatives, they are bringing life into materials that otherwise
                            could have been a nuisance to the environment.

The 1st African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) convened from 26th - 27th
October, 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, on the theme “African Youth Responses to Climate
Change and Food Security, Action from the Frontline.” The conference was organized by Africa
Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) in partnership with Africa Climate Policy Center
(ACPC), New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), Pan African Climate Justice
Alliance (PACJA) and Zimbabwe United Nations Association (ZUNA).
100 youths selected across Africa in the conference addressing the thematic strands of Youth in
Agribusiness; Climate Change and Development in Africa; Sustainable Agriculture and Food
Security; Green Economy and Technology Transfer; Climate Justice and Human Rights; and
Climate Change and Disaster risk reduction participated in this first edition of the African Youth
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC). This came at a time when Africa as a continent
continues to bear the biggest brunt of climate change due to low resilience and weak capacities,
with the youth despite their huge numbers and innovativeness among the vulnerable alongside
women. Despite the odds, they have been actively engaged in adaptation and mitigation




                                                                   O
initiatives that improve their communities’ resilience to climate change.
The conference therefore provided a platform for the African youths to interact and share best
practices. Five flagship projects were selected to be used as case studies by African Youths in
starting their own projects depending on transferability. The conference also saw the drafting of




                                                M
African youth position for COP 21 which was handed over to African Group of Negotiators at the
fifth Climate Change and Development in Africa Conference (CCDA V).

(AfriYOCC-2016)

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the environmental challenge of climate
change is already modifying Africa’s economies and livelihoods, health, social structure,
infrastructure and natural systems. Over the years, African youth have proved their potential in
both promoting and implementing climate change adaptation projects in their communities.
Their innovations have continually been adopted in responding to climate change impacts. This
is despite various challenges that include low capacity and education, high rates of poverty and
lack of financial resources. At the same time, African youth have been minimally represented in
the respective country policy processes as well as during the UNFCCC climate change
negotiations. Above 50% of the African population are the youth. This justifies the urgent need
for youth capacity development to respond to climate change and inclusion as key stakeholders
in policy process and negotiations. AYICC aims to spearhead new innovations, look into new
systems of success to share with policy and decision-makers, and generally aim to improve on
the current system which is causing long-term and irreversible degradation to our livelihoods –
as the leading youth organization on climate change in Africa.



                                                                    O
In cognizance of the role and potential of the African youth in climate change mitigation and
adaptation and overall sustainable development trajectory, the second African Youth




                                                 M
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC), shall be held in Nairobi, Kenya on 10th to 13th
October, 2016 as AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its formation in 2006 during the
second Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12. Building on the success of the first




                                               E
edition of conference, AfriYOCC shall provide an avenue for African youths to showcase their
climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, projects and initiatives. Best practices
arising from the various AYICC country chapters shall be developed to an African youth




                                    D
climate change adaptation and mitigation best practices database and handbook. The
meeting will dilate on the current post 2015 development agenda and the role of young
people in championing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in
Africa.

The delegates shall have an opportunity to visit ongoing Climate Change adaptation and
agribusiness projects in Kenya for hands-on skills and knowledge replicable in their countries.
Consequently, it shall boost the skills and capacities of African youths to substantially contribute
to the process leading towards and during COP 22. Through partnership with both
Governmental and Non-governmental agencies, the conference shall not only negotiate for
more youth representation in the respective country policy processes towards the forthcoming
CoPs and country specific policies, but also provide learning and engagement opportunities for
African youths. This will greatly enhance their current capacity and potential to actively
participate in both national and international platforms for policy formulation and implementation.
The conference will also provide a platform to re-assess the current position of our negotiators
and create awareness about the critical role young people should play in shifting agendas in the
forthcoming Conference of Parties in Marrakech come November 2016. While a 4 day gathering

"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS001_ALA","seem insufficient, the conference will pave the way for active engagement of African youth into
issues affecting their livelihoods.

African youth have for long been side-lined to the periphery of the substantive civic and policy
issues facing the continent. However, the worst affected are the rural based youths and those
residing in farming communities, peri-urban areas and those from conflict and post conflict
countries. This has resulted in youths from these marginalized communities having no
knowledge and information on the basic climate change science and adaptation and mitigation
mechanisms. The good news though is that there is capacity amongst many young people who
are already in the circles of upcoming academia, policy specialists, lawyers, journalists and
scientists’ alike. These capacities need to be strengthened and skills shared amongst the wider
group of young people on the continent so that best practices are disseminated and resources
are expanded.

While it is an undeniable fact that climate change is affecting all regions globally, especially in
developing countries, the adverse effects in the future is likely to increase if the Paris agreement
is not ratified and effectuated by all parties. And even though a deal was achieved during
COP21 in Paris, the impacts of climate change will definitely continue into the future. This
suggests that young people will have to not just understand what climate change is and how it is




                                                                      O
affecting our world, opportunities that exists within, but most importantly, participate actively into
finding amicable solutions. Young people of Africa have therefore considered it an inherent
imperative to contribute to their future by organizing the 2nd African Youth Conference on
Climate Change in October 2016 under the theme, ‘Making Climate Finance work for




                                                  M
African Youth.’


2.1 CONFERENCE STRATEGY




                                                E
The conference program shall be based on exploring mechanisms to finance climate adaptation
and mitigation through Innovations in agriculture, technology and other sectors. It shall be




                                     D
highly interactive with unique workshop-style design that enables participants to develop their
potential through practical experience. Participants will divide to participate in thematic
workshops and come up with an African Youth position paper and concrete activities to be
included in the African Youth Strategy on Climate Change.

The delegates shall be engaged in pre-conference activities that shall include and not limited to,
mapping of youth climate change and/or mitigation projects within the conference key focus
areas for selection as best practice and include in the African youth climate change adaptation
and mitigation best practices database and handbook and aggressively fundraise towards their
participation and a successful workshop. The conference shall critically examine the various
country positions and the overall continents positions of the African Group of Negotiators, their
achievements and potentials towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It shall
examine the youth voices in these positions and further develop African youth position for
COP22.

We expect 200 youth leaders to participate in this conference. The conference is convened by
the AYICC continental secretariat in collaboration with AYICC Kenya chapter and the member

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is an umbrella youth network of African
based youth organizations, university groups, rural youth groups, schools, and individuals
working on climate change and sustainable development issues. It aims at developing capacity
and strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent need to take action
against the impacts of climate change for both present and future generations.

The initiative (always referred to as the movement) was conceived in Nairobi Kenya 10 years
ago, during the second Conference of Youth (COY2) preceding the 12th Conference of Parties
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC - COP12). The
main reason for its founding was to ensure the inclusion, and active participation of youths from
the south, and specifically Africa, in the international climate change negotiations. This was
needed as the youth are more than half the African population and are most affected by climate
change impacts. They also got massive potential to support the continent to take action on
global warming.

During its formation, it comprised of 8 country chapters and current has grown to 45 country
chapters with over 20,000 members across Africa and the Diaspora. This initiative has provided




                                                                  O
a platform for knowledge, ideas and experiences sharing. It is also an avenue for development
of skills and strategies on youth action on climate change mitigation and adaptation in the
African continent. AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a
platform for them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the




                                               M
UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others.

Since its inception, we have worked in partnership with international youth movements and have




                                             E
played a great role in the establishment of the International Youth Climate Movement whose
youth member organizations are now officially acknowledged by the UNFCCC as the YOUNGO
(Youth NGOs involved in the climate change negotiations process). Since COY2 in Nairobi, it




                                   D
has had youth delegates’ representation in all COP meetings.

In addition to the above, we have had landmark successes that include:
     A reach out programme for a children’s home (Watoto Wema in Ruai) and School
        climate change education program run in selected schools in Kenya.
     Leadership and mentorship programmes especially on volunteerism.
     Community development projects particularly on clean energy (energy saving stoves for
        rural folks)
     Capacity development of youth on agribusiness
     Advocacy campaigns e.g. lobbied for lanes to be set aside along the major highways for
        non-motorised transport especially for cyclists.
     Policy engagements i.e. contributing to the climate change bill 2012,as stakeholders
     Youth Caravan from Kenya to Durban during COP 17

African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) 2016

African Youth Conference on Climate Change will take place in Nairobi in Kenya. The conference is organized by the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change
(AYICC) and the African Climate Policy Centre from the 10 to 13 October 2016. AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its fonmation in 2006 during the second
Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12.

African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) www.ayicc.net is a continental youth network that was conceived in 2006 in Nairobi Kenya, during the
Conference of Youth held just before the UNFCCC COP12. This initiative has continued to link, and share knowledge, ideas, experiences, skills and strategies
on youth action around the continent on climate change, its mitigation and adaptation and sustainable development. In 2009, AYICC was granted observer
status to the African Minister Conference on Environment (AMCEN). AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a platform for
them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the Conference of Parties of UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others. AYICC
currently operates in over 45 African countries with over 20,000 members.

In response, to the call by AU Heads of Sates and Government to establish the CAHOSCC Youth Programme on Climate Change (CYPCC),

Founding Opportunities


AYICC Founding Opportunities

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the
environmental challenge of climate change will ultimately modify Africa's economies and livelihoods, health, social structure, infrastructure and natural
systems. To date little has been done to empower, capacitate and mobilise youth, particularly in Africa to address global environmental challenges such as
climate change. facebook d o w n ~ To remedy this, an initial step has been the formation of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC).

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change was formed partially in response to the poor representation of young Africans at the International Youth
Summit on Climate Change (November 24-28, 2005), which was held in conjunction with the United Nation's Climate Change Conference (November 28-
December 10, 2005) in Montreal , Canada. The overall mission of AYICC is to ensure that African youth are equipped toparticipate in future UNFCCC
meetings and other global initiatives for sustainable solutions to environmental degradation and climate change.

In order to ensure a strong youth presence in climate change dialogue and fora, there is a need for AYICC to ensure youth representation from various parts
of Africa. This will enable Africa's youth to engage with the global youth movement, governments and NGO's in a more coordinated and sustained manner.
The long term goal is to ensure sustainable and systematic global youth action, with special emphasis on African youth on the issue of climate change.

Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any financial assistance. The planning committee members have
volunteered their time and their contributions. However, in order to make this vision a reality we need to become a financially viable organisation. For this
reason, we would like to request your financial assistance in getting this vision off the ground.•

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE ADF 7 OPENING FORUM, 12TH OCT.10

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE OPENING FORUM OF THE SEVENTH AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FORUM, 12TH OCTOBER

2010: Ms. Esther Agbarakwe, Nigeria




The Chair,

Climate Change poses significant challenges to future generations. As youth we have a stake in this future; it is our future.




                                                                                                                 O
As the 7th African Development Forum, we have indeed come of age, we are no longer in our childhood stages of determining sustainable development - the
time of maturity has arrived. This year is marked as the International Year of Youth and now, more than ever before, the youth are taking a stand. More than
anyone else, we, the Youth, face unprecedented challenges as a result of global climate change. We also share the responsibility of addressing ii. As a group,
we are key moral stakeholders in the international processes treating the most important challenge of our generation. As it is our future, we will be
disproportionately affected by the catastrophic impacts of climate change.

Advocacy and Behavior Change: II is critical for present and future leaders to collaborate on finding solutions. The need for cultural transformation in our time




                                                                              M
is stronger than ever. This transformation - that enables us to shift towards a more sustainable world - should be an organic process, guided by principles of
compassion, integrity and justice. We need to pragmatically rethink our behavioral patterns, to enable a paradigm shift that is based on an ongoing process of
action, reflection and meaningful participation. Awareness, education and empowerment are fundamental prerequisites to enabling this process, and the youth
are energetic and passionate about holding governments and all relevant stakeholders involved accountable for their actions. We are equal partners in this
process and commit ourselves fully to achieving the objectives as decided by this Forum.




                                                                            E
Contrary to what is believed; young people play a dynamic role in framing and implementing policies. So their role goes beyond advocacy. From an advocacy
perspective, young people are involved in songs and stories which spread awareness in local languages. Of course we understand the importance and
relevance of this because 70% of Africa is based in rural areas and the term Climate Change is foreign, Young people are finding ways of using words in local
languages to translate the message across.




                                                           D
It is time to shift the balance of decision-making towards the generation that will have to manage this unwanted inheritance, to make political and economic
decisions that can span a generation, and to enable real inter-generational and inter-cultural dialogue about climate change to be realized in institutions where
the youth generation can learn.

However at the same time a range of social learning and marketing approaches need to be developed to address the gap between classroom education styles
and education that stimulates real action. This gap prevents the cultural shift from token awareness to personal action and reaction.

Education: In relation to climate change, African Governments should begin at inception to mainstream youth voices and perceptions. This is particularly
important because climate change projections indicate that effects will begin to be most felt in the next 20-30 years - young people should begin to be part of
the solution so that they will be able to cope when disaster calls. Involving them in this programme will ensure that those who will be affected will have direct
knowledge of the challenges and strategies for coping as well as the ability to mobilize communities to respond to and prepare for the impact of climate change
and natural disasters.

Governments must give credence to the higher learning education system in Africa in particular the increased accent on improvement of research and
innovation on climate change specifically highlighting on policy and reform, the programmes, pedagogy and teaching tools. This will enhance an equipped pool
of intellectual capital among the young people on climate change issues who will replicate this to the various organizations and networks that they are part of.

Al government level, during the last Conference of the Parties (COP), ii was pleasing to see that many African delegations included youth and gave them a role
to play. Furthermore, many youth who were involved in COP 15 deliberations have been interacting with their various governments and engaging in processes
and procedures that are related to Climate change policy. There is an understanding that more needs to be done, and at this forum, I urge you to engage young
people who knock on your doors asking to be involved.

Youth and youth based NGOs play a major role either in strengthening local capacity to cope or by supporting local action. Already, groups such as the Nigerian
Youth Coalition and the African youth Climate Initiative-Kenya have established school climate clubs, which are creative ways to engage young people; these
initiatives should be mainstreamed into education systems. Young people in this governance process are important because successful adaptation requires a
host of innovative measures developed with vulnerable communities to improve their present and future livelihoods. Young people are vibrant and are able to
access places that many governmental institutions fail to access. As the majority of the population and Africa's future, it is important to include them in this
impending crisis that is Climate Change.

Already, this conference calls for integrated approaches to enable African countries to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change. There is a dire need
to have a clearer understanding of the potential calamities that climate change can bring and to start the discourse on how best to stave off the worst impacts.
There is already an understanding that

Climate Change is not a localized problem but transcends national borders, hence the need for co-operation of Intergovernmental agencies but also to include
those young and vulnerable people.

Conclusion :
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS001_ALA","No longer can climate change be seen as merely an environmental problem or an energy challenge. It is a combination of both, which needs the involvement of
young people to preserve the environment and enter into green energy careers.

It's important for all of us to recognize that sustainable development isn't just a catch phrase - people all over the continent are taking it into their own hands. A
couple days ago over 300 community events took place in nearly every country on the continent of Africa, and more than 7000 globally as part of the Global
Work Party on 10/10/10.

Everywhere in the wortd, people planted trees, cultivated community gardens, installed solar panels, made buildings more efficient and implemented thousands
of other grassroots solutions to the climate crisis. We got to work everywhere in the world, but we need you, leaders, to get to work, too.

Thank you and God bless

                        African Youth at COP25

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS001_ALA","The 25th session of the Conference Parties (COP25) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held from the 2 -13
December bringing together nearly 27000 people to the Spanish capital. COP25
provided parties with the opportunity to finalize the ""rulebook"" of the Paris
Agreement - the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020.


In the spirit of the convention on climate change young people continue to enjoy




                                                                          O
various spaces during COP mainly through YOU NGO; the official youth
constituency to the UNFCCC. Article 6 ofthe Convention and Article 12 of the
Paris Agreement referred to as Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) encourage
the empowerment of every member of the society to take climate actions and
therefore young people who are most vulnerable to the climate crisis are




                                             M
increasingly becoming the centre of discussion.


The world today is home to the largest generation of young people in history and
their energy, creativity, and innovation, when harnessed properly, will accelerate




                                           E
sustainable solutions to the global crisis. Youth have a pivotal role to play in the
implementation of ACE which consists of six elements namely: education,
training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and
international cooperation.




                             D
At COP25, the Intergenerational Inquiry which is a highlight event of Young and
Future Generations Day and like every year provided a platform for youth and
decision-makers to discuss how young people can enhance the implementation
of the Paris Agreement. This platform was attended by the Executive Secretary of
the UNFCCC and provided an opportunity for young people to share the
outcome on the Conference of Youth (COY 15) to the secretariat.


The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) has continued to
empower and mobilize young people at COP through our side events and
exhibitions. Through an exhibition at COP 25, AYICC was able to showcase the
actions and contributions of African youth in the fight against climate change.
Such actions include ecological restorations, renewable energy promotion, and
local conference of youth hosted by our national chapters.


AYICC's greatest concern however, is with regards to the low representation of
African youth at the UNFCCC sessions. There are many contributing factors which
includes lack of funding, inability to assess accreditations and visas. As the first
step in addressing this, we will continue to encourage African countries to make
conscious efforts to include youth delegates in their official delegations for COPs.
We also call on development partners and stakeholders who are interested in
youth development to reach out with their support to AYICC to enhance African
youth participation in this important global process.

Climate Change


• Campaigns and Advocacy
 The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is widely known for our
 incessant campaigns and research-based advocacy on environmental and
 climate change topics. Since 2006 AYICC has been consistent with its
 campaigns impressing on African governments and international community
 alike to deliver on their commitment under the United Nations Framework
 Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) .



• Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)
 Climate change education, training, and awareness creation have been the
 central focus of AYICC targeting youth and vulnerable communities. We do
 this through workshops, conferences, and webinars leveraging on our robust
 online presence. Through our Flagship program; the African Youth Conference
 on Climate Change (AFRIYOCC) we are able to provide a platform for




                                                                     O
 exchange of ideas and sharing of knowledge and best practices among young
 African thereby feeding into article 6 of the climate change convention and
 article 12 of the Paris Agreement.



• Tree planting and Ecological restoration



                                         M
 Trees contribute to their environment by providing oxygen, improving air
 quality, climate amelioration, conserving water, preserving soil, and




                                       E
 supporting wildlife. Beyond the campaigns and advocacies, our member
 organizations embark on tree planting and reforestation activities including
 mangrove restoration along the coast.




                         D
• Renewable energy promotion
 With the increasing demand for energy for industrial and economic
 development, AYICC member organizations in different countries are
 promoting renewable energy access to isolated off-grid communities. AYICC
 believes that Youth-led renewable energy enterprises are a viable means of
 achieving sustainable development, as they promote technologies that are
 less harmful to the global environs while at the same time providing
 sustainable income-generating opportunities for youth .



• Youth in Agribusiness
 AYICC sees agriculture as an essential driver of economic development and an
 area of great opportunity for young people in Africa. The challenge, however,
 is that the growing youth population does not see agriculture as a profitable
 opportunity due to their lack of insight into the opportunities that exist within
 the agriculture value chain. Through our member organizations who are youth
 farmers themselves, AYICC has adopted various strategies including outreach
 to schools and communities, exhibitions and youth agricultural festivals as
 well as institution of award schemes for best youth farmers as a way to raise
 interest and awareness on the opportunities that exist within this sector.



• Recycling
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS001_ALA","                            Over recent years, the world has witnessed an increasing level of waste
                            products as a by-product of the increasing level of population, affluence, and
                            technological advancement in a given environment or society. In Africa we
                            have witnessed increasing level of pollution from plastic, car tires, bottles
                            among others and this has generated innovative thinking among young
                            people to provide a sustainable solution. Over the years, AYICC members have
                            redefined waste as a resource for sustainable development and through
                            various recycling initiatives, they are bringing life into materials that otherwise
                            could have been a nuisance to the environment.

The 1st African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) convened from 26th - 27th
October, 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, on the theme “African Youth Responses to Climate
Change and Food Security, Action from the Frontline.” The conference was organized by Africa
Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) in partnership with Africa Climate Policy Center
(ACPC), New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), Pan African Climate Justice
Alliance (PACJA) and Zimbabwe United Nations Association (ZUNA).
100 youths selected across Africa in the conference addressing the thematic strands of Youth in
Agribusiness; Climate Change and Development in Africa; Sustainable Agriculture and Food
Security; Green Economy and Technology Transfer; Climate Justice and Human Rights; and
Climate Change and Disaster risk reduction participated in this first edition of the African Youth
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC). This came at a time when Africa as a continent
continues to bear the biggest brunt of climate change due to low resilience and weak capacities,
with the youth despite their huge numbers and innovativeness among the vulnerable alongside
women. Despite the odds, they have been actively engaged in adaptation and mitigation




                                                                   O
initiatives that improve their communities’ resilience to climate change.
The conference therefore provided a platform for the African youths to interact and share best
practices. Five flagship projects were selected to be used as case studies by African Youths in
starting their own projects depending on transferability. The conference also saw the drafting of




                                                M
African youth position for COP 21 which was handed over to African Group of Negotiators at the
fifth Climate Change and Development in Africa Conference (CCDA V).

(AfriYOCC-2016)

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the environmental challenge of climate
change is already modifying Africa’s economies and livelihoods, health, social structure,
infrastructure and natural systems. Over the years, African youth have proved their potential in
both promoting and implementing climate change adaptation projects in their communities.
Their innovations have continually been adopted in responding to climate change impacts. This
is despite various challenges that include low capacity and education, high rates of poverty and
lack of financial resources. At the same time, African youth have been minimally represented in
the respective country policy processes as well as during the UNFCCC climate change
negotiations. Above 50% of the African population are the youth. This justifies the urgent need
for youth capacity development to respond to climate change and inclusion as key stakeholders
in policy process and negotiations. AYICC aims to spearhead new innovations, look into new
systems of success to share with policy and decision-makers, and generally aim to improve on
the current system which is causing long-term and irreversible degradation to our livelihoods –
as the leading youth organization on climate change in Africa.



                                                                    O
In cognizance of the role and potential of the African youth in climate change mitigation and
adaptation and overall sustainable development trajectory, the second African Youth




                                                 M
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC), shall be held in Nairobi, Kenya on 10th to 13th
October, 2016 as AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its formation in 2006 during the
second Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12. Building on the success of the first




                                               E
edition of conference, AfriYOCC shall provide an avenue for African youths to showcase their
climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, projects and initiatives. Best practices
arising from the various AYICC country chapters shall be developed to an African youth




                                    D
climate change adaptation and mitigation best practices database and handbook. The
meeting will dilate on the current post 2015 development agenda and the role of young
people in championing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in
Africa.

The delegates shall have an opportunity to visit ongoing Climate Change adaptation and
agribusiness projects in Kenya for hands-on skills and knowledge replicable in their countries.
Consequently, it shall boost the skills and capacities of African youths to substantially contribute
to the process leading towards and during COP 22. Through partnership with both
Governmental and Non-governmental agencies, the conference shall not only negotiate for
more youth representation in the respective country policy processes towards the forthcoming
CoPs and country specific policies, but also provide learning and engagement opportunities for
African youths. This will greatly enhance their current capacity and potential to actively
participate in both national and international platforms for policy formulation and implementation.
The conference will also provide a platform to re-assess the current position of our negotiators
and create awareness about the critical role young people should play in shifting agendas in the
forthcoming Conference of Parties in Marrakech come November 2016. While a 4 day gathering

"

issues affecting their livelihoods.

African youth have for long been side-lined to the periphery of the substantive civic and policy
issues facing the continent. However, the worst affected are the rural based youths and those
residing in farming communities, peri-urban areas and those from conflict and post conflict
countries. This has resulted in youths from these marginalized communities having no
knowledge and information on the basic climate change science and adaptation and mitigation
mechanisms. The good news though is that there is capacity amongst many young people who
are already in the circles of upcoming academia, policy specialists, lawyers, journalists and
scientists’ alike. These capacities need to be strengthened and skills shared amongst the wider
group of young people on the continent so that best practices are disseminated and resources
are expanded.

While it is an undeniable fact that climate change is affecting all regions globally, especially in
developing countries, the adverse effects in the future is likely to increase if the Paris agreement
is not ratified and effectuated by all parties. And even though a deal was achieved during
COP21 in Paris, the impacts of climate change will definitely continue into the future. This
suggests that young people will have to not just understand what climate change is and how it is




                                                                      O
affecting our world, opportunities that exists within, but most importantly, participate actively into
finding amicable solutions. Young people of Africa have therefore considered it an inherent
imperative to contribute to their future by organizing the 2nd African Youth Conference on
Climate Change in October 2016 under the theme, ‘Making Climate Finance work for




                                                  M
African Youth.’


2.1 CONFERENCE STRATEGY




                                                E
The conference program shall be based on exploring mechanisms to finance climate adaptation
and mitigation through Innovations in agriculture, technology and other sectors. It shall be




                                     D
highly interactive with unique workshop-style design that enables participants to develop their
potential through practical experience. Participants will divide to participate in thematic
workshops and come up with an African Youth position paper and concrete activities to be
included in the African Youth Strategy on Climate Change.

The delegates shall be engaged in pre-conference activities that shall include and not limited to,
mapping of youth climate change and/or mitigation projects within the conference key focus
areas for selection as best practice and include in the African youth climate change adaptation
and mitigation best practices database and handbook and aggressively fundraise towards their
participation and a successful workshop. The conference shall critically examine the various
country positions and the overall continents positions of the African Group of Negotiators, their
achievements and potentials towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It shall
examine the youth voices in these positions and further develop African youth position for
COP22.

We expect 200 youth leaders to participate in this conference. The conference is convened by
the AYICC continental secretariat in collaboration with AYICC Kenya chapter and the member

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is an umbrella youth network of African
based youth organizations, university groups, rural youth groups, schools, and individuals
working on climate change and sustainable development issues. It aims at developing capacity
and strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent need to take action
against the impacts of climate change for both present and future generations.

The initiative (always referred to as the movement) was conceived in Nairobi Kenya 10 years
ago, during the second Conference of Youth (COY2) preceding the 12th Conference of Parties
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC - COP12). The
main reason for its founding was to ensure the inclusion, and active participation of youths from
the south, and specifically Africa, in the international climate change negotiations. This was
needed as the youth are more than half the African population and are most affected by climate
change impacts. They also got massive potential to support the continent to take action on
global warming.

During its formation, it comprised of 8 country chapters and current has grown to 45 country
chapters with over 20,000 members across Africa and the Diaspora. This initiative has provided




                                                                  O
a platform for knowledge, ideas and experiences sharing. It is also an avenue for development
of skills and strategies on youth action on climate change mitigation and adaptation in the
African continent. AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a
platform for them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the




                                               M
UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others.

Since its inception, we have worked in partnership with international youth movements and have




                                             E
played a great role in the establishment of the International Youth Climate Movement whose
youth member organizations are now officially acknowledged by the UNFCCC as the YOUNGO
(Youth NGOs involved in the climate change negotiations process). Since COY2 in Nairobi, it




                                   D
has had youth delegates’ representation in all COP meetings.

In addition to the above, we have had landmark successes that include:
     A reach out programme for a children’s home (Watoto Wema in Ruai) and School
        climate change education program run in selected schools in Kenya.
     Leadership and mentorship programmes especially on volunteerism.
     Community development projects particularly on clean energy (energy saving stoves for
        rural folks)
     Capacity development of youth on agribusiness
     Advocacy campaigns e.g. lobbied for lanes to be set aside along the major highways for
        non-motorised transport especially for cyclists.
     Policy engagements i.e. contributing to the climate change bill 2012,as stakeholders
     Youth Caravan from Kenya to Durban during COP 17

African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) 2016

African Youth Conference on Climate Change will take place in Nairobi in Kenya. The conference is organized by the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change
(AYICC) and the African Climate Policy Centre from the 10 to 13 October 2016. AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its fonmation in 2006 during the second
Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12.

African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) www.ayicc.net is a continental youth network that was conceived in 2006 in Nairobi Kenya, during the
Conference of Youth held just before the UNFCCC COP12. This initiative has continued to link, and share knowledge, ideas, experiences, skills and strategies
on youth action around the continent on climate change, its mitigation and adaptation and sustainable development. In 2009, AYICC was granted observer
status to the African Minister Conference on Environment (AMCEN). AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a platform for
them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the Conference of Parties of UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others. AYICC
currently operates in over 45 African countries with over 20,000 members.

In response, to the call by AU Heads of Sates and Government to establish the CAHOSCC Youth Programme on Climate Change (CYPCC),

Founding Opportunities


AYICC Founding Opportunities

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the
environmental challenge of climate change will ultimately modify Africa's economies and livelihoods, health, social structure, infrastructure and natural
systems. To date little has been done to empower, capacitate and mobilise youth, particularly in Africa to address global environmental challenges such as
climate change. facebook d o w n ~ To remedy this, an initial step has been the formation of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC).

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change was formed partially in response to the poor representation of young Africans at the International Youth
Summit on Climate Change (November 24-28, 2005), which was held in conjunction with the United Nation's Climate Change Conference (November 28-
December 10, 2005) in Montreal , Canada. The overall mission of AYICC is to ensure that African youth are equipped toparticipate in future UNFCCC
meetings and other global initiatives for sustainable solutions to environmental degradation and climate change.

In order to ensure a strong youth presence in climate change dialogue and fora, there is a need for AYICC to ensure youth representation from various parts
of Africa. This will enable Africa's youth to engage with the global youth movement, governments and NGO's in a more coordinated and sustained manner.
The long term goal is to ensure sustainable and systematic global youth action, with special emphasis on African youth on the issue of climate change.

Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any financial assistance. The planning committee members have
volunteered their time and their contributions. However, in order to make this vision a reality we need to become a financially viable organisation. For this
reason, we would like to request your financial assistance in getting this vision off the ground.•

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE ADF 7 OPENING FORUM, 12TH OCT.10

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE OPENING FORUM OF THE SEVENTH AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FORUM, 12TH OCTOBER

2010: Ms. Esther Agbarakwe, Nigeria




The Chair,

Climate Change poses significant challenges to future generations. As youth we have a stake in this future; it is our future.




                                                                                                                 O
As the 7th African Development Forum, we have indeed come of age, we are no longer in our childhood stages of determining sustainable development - the
time of maturity has arrived. This year is marked as the International Year of Youth and now, more than ever before, the youth are taking a stand. More than
anyone else, we, the Youth, face unprecedented challenges as a result of global climate change. We also share the responsibility of addressing ii. As a group,
we are key moral stakeholders in the international processes treating the most important challenge of our generation. As it is our future, we will be
disproportionately affected by the catastrophic impacts of climate change.

Advocacy and Behavior Change: II is critical for present and future leaders to collaborate on finding solutions. The need for cultural transformation in our time




                                                                              M
is stronger than ever. This transformation - that enables us to shift towards a more sustainable world - should be an organic process, guided by principles of
compassion, integrity and justice. We need to pragmatically rethink our behavioral patterns, to enable a paradigm shift that is based on an ongoing process of
action, reflection and meaningful participation. Awareness, education and empowerment are fundamental prerequisites to enabling this process, and the youth
are energetic and passionate about holding governments and all relevant stakeholders involved accountable for their actions. We are equal partners in this
process and commit ourselves fully to achieving the objectives as decided by this Forum.




                                                                            E
Contrary to what is believed; young people play a dynamic role in framing and implementing policies. So their role goes beyond advocacy. From an advocacy
perspective, young people are involved in songs and stories which spread awareness in local languages. Of course we understand the importance and
relevance of this because 70% of Africa is based in rural areas and the term Climate Change is foreign, Young people are finding ways of using words in local
languages to translate the message across.




                                                           D
It is time to shift the balance of decision-making towards the generation that will have to manage this unwanted inheritance, to make political and economic
decisions that can span a generation, and to enable real inter-generational and inter-cultural dialogue about climate change to be realized in institutions where
the youth generation can learn.

However at the same time a range of social learning and marketing approaches need to be developed to address the gap between classroom education styles
and education that stimulates real action. This gap prevents the cultural shift from token awareness to personal action and reaction.

Education: In relation to climate change, African Governments should begin at inception to mainstream youth voices and perceptions. This is particularly
important because climate change projections indicate that effects will begin to be most felt in the next 20-30 years - young people should begin to be part of
the solution so that they will be able to cope when disaster calls. Involving them in this programme will ensure that those who will be affected will have direct
knowledge of the challenges and strategies for coping as well as the ability to mobilize communities to respond to and prepare for the impact of climate change
and natural disasters.

Governments must give credence to the higher learning education system in Africa in particular the increased accent on improvement of research and
innovation on climate change specifically highlighting on policy and reform, the programmes, pedagogy and teaching tools. This will enhance an equipped pool
of intellectual capital among the young people on climate change issues who will replicate this to the various organizations and networks that they are part of.

Al government level, during the last Conference of the Parties (COP), ii was pleasing to see that many African delegations included youth and gave them a role
to play. Furthermore, many youth who were involved in COP 15 deliberations have been interacting with their various governments and engaging in processes
and procedures that are related to Climate change policy. There is an understanding that more needs to be done, and at this forum, I urge you to engage young
people who knock on your doors asking to be involved.

Youth and youth based NGOs play a major role either in strengthening local capacity to cope or by supporting local action. Already, groups such as the Nigerian
Youth Coalition and the African youth Climate Initiative-Kenya have established school climate clubs, which are creative ways to engage young people; these
initiatives should be mainstreamed into education systems. Young people in this governance process are important because successful adaptation requires a
host of innovative measures developed with vulnerable communities to improve their present and future livelihoods. Young people are vibrant and are able to
access places that many governmental institutions fail to access. As the majority of the population and Africa's future, it is important to include them in this
impending crisis that is Climate Change.

Already, this conference calls for integrated approaches to enable African countries to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change. There is a dire need
to have a clearer understanding of the potential calamities that climate change can bring and to start the discourse on how best to stave off the worst impacts.
There is already an understanding that

Climate Change is not a localized problem but transcends national borders, hence the need for co-operation of Intergovernmental agencies but also to include
those young and vulnerable people.

Conclusion :
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS004_AfrikaTikkun","No longer can climate change be seen as merely an environmental problem or an energy challenge. It is a combination of both, which needs the involvement of
young people to preserve the environment and enter into green energy careers.

It's important for all of us to recognize that sustainable development isn't just a catch phrase - people all over the continent are taking it into their own hands. A
couple days ago over 300 community events took place in nearly every country on the continent of Africa, and more than 7000 globally as part of the Global
Work Party on 10/10/10.

Everywhere in the wortd, people planted trees, cultivated community gardens, installed solar panels, made buildings more efficient and implemented thousands
of other grassroots solutions to the climate crisis. We got to work everywhere in the world, but we need you, leaders, to get to work, too.

Thank you and God bless

                        African Youth at COP25

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS004_AfrikaTikkun","The 25th session of the Conference Parties (COP25) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held from the 2 -13
December bringing together nearly 27000 people to the Spanish capital. COP25
provided parties with the opportunity to finalize the ""rulebook"" of the Paris
Agreement - the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020.


In the spirit of the convention on climate change young people continue to enjoy




                                                                          O
various spaces during COP mainly through YOU NGO; the official youth
constituency to the UNFCCC. Article 6 ofthe Convention and Article 12 of the
Paris Agreement referred to as Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) encourage
the empowerment of every member of the society to take climate actions and
therefore young people who are most vulnerable to the climate crisis are




                                             M
increasingly becoming the centre of discussion.


The world today is home to the largest generation of young people in history and
their energy, creativity, and innovation, when harnessed properly, will accelerate




                                           E
sustainable solutions to the global crisis. Youth have a pivotal role to play in the
implementation of ACE which consists of six elements namely: education,
training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and
international cooperation.




                             D
At COP25, the Intergenerational Inquiry which is a highlight event of Young and
Future Generations Day and like every year provided a platform for youth and
decision-makers to discuss how young people can enhance the implementation
of the Paris Agreement. This platform was attended by the Executive Secretary of
the UNFCCC and provided an opportunity for young people to share the
outcome on the Conference of Youth (COY 15) to the secretariat.


The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) has continued to
empower and mobilize young people at COP through our side events and
exhibitions. Through an exhibition at COP 25, AYICC was able to showcase the
actions and contributions of African youth in the fight against climate change.
Such actions include ecological restorations, renewable energy promotion, and
local conference of youth hosted by our national chapters.


AYICC's greatest concern however, is with regards to the low representation of
African youth at the UNFCCC sessions. There are many contributing factors which
includes lack of funding, inability to assess accreditations and visas. As the first
step in addressing this, we will continue to encourage African countries to make
conscious efforts to include youth delegates in their official delegations for COPs.
We also call on development partners and stakeholders who are interested in
youth development to reach out with their support to AYICC to enhance African
youth participation in this important global process.

Climate Change


• Campaigns and Advocacy
 The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is widely known for our
 incessant campaigns and research-based advocacy on environmental and
 climate change topics. Since 2006 AYICC has been consistent with its
 campaigns impressing on African governments and international community
 alike to deliver on their commitment under the United Nations Framework
 Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) .



• Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)
 Climate change education, training, and awareness creation have been the
 central focus of AYICC targeting youth and vulnerable communities. We do
 this through workshops, conferences, and webinars leveraging on our robust
 online presence. Through our Flagship program; the African Youth Conference
 on Climate Change (AFRIYOCC) we are able to provide a platform for




                                                                     O
 exchange of ideas and sharing of knowledge and best practices among young
 African thereby feeding into article 6 of the climate change convention and
 article 12 of the Paris Agreement.



• Tree planting and Ecological restoration



                                         M
 Trees contribute to their environment by providing oxygen, improving air
 quality, climate amelioration, conserving water, preserving soil, and




                                       E
 supporting wildlife. Beyond the campaigns and advocacies, our member
 organizations embark on tree planting and reforestation activities including
 mangrove restoration along the coast.




                         D
• Renewable energy promotion
 With the increasing demand for energy for industrial and economic
 development, AYICC member organizations in different countries are
 promoting renewable energy access to isolated off-grid communities. AYICC
 believes that Youth-led renewable energy enterprises are a viable means of
 achieving sustainable development, as they promote technologies that are
 less harmful to the global environs while at the same time providing
 sustainable income-generating opportunities for youth .



• Youth in Agribusiness
 AYICC sees agriculture as an essential driver of economic development and an
 area of great opportunity for young people in Africa. The challenge, however,
 is that the growing youth population does not see agriculture as a profitable
 opportunity due to their lack of insight into the opportunities that exist within
 the agriculture value chain. Through our member organizations who are youth
 farmers themselves, AYICC has adopted various strategies including outreach
 to schools and communities, exhibitions and youth agricultural festivals as
 well as institution of award schemes for best youth farmers as a way to raise
 interest and awareness on the opportunities that exist within this sector.

                            products as a by-product of the increasing level of population, affluence, and
                            technological advancement in a given environment or society. In Africa we
                            have witnessed increasing level of pollution from plastic, car tires, bottles
                            among others and this has generated innovative thinking among young
                            people to provide a sustainable solution. Over the years, AYICC members have
                            redefined waste as a resource for sustainable development and through
                            various recycling initiatives, they are bringing life into materials that otherwise
                            could have been a nuisance to the environment.

The 1st African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) convened from 26th - 27th
October, 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, on the theme “African Youth Responses to Climate
Change and Food Security, Action from the Frontline.” The conference was organized by Africa
Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) in partnership with Africa Climate Policy Center
(ACPC), New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), Pan African Climate Justice
Alliance (PACJA) and Zimbabwe United Nations Association (ZUNA).
100 youths selected across Africa in the conference addressing the thematic strands of Youth in
Agribusiness; Climate Change and Development in Africa; Sustainable Agriculture and Food
Security; Green Economy and Technology Transfer; Climate Justice and Human Rights; and
Climate Change and Disaster risk reduction participated in this first edition of the African Youth
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC). This came at a time when Africa as a continent
continues to bear the biggest brunt of climate change due to low resilience and weak capacities,
with the youth despite their huge numbers and innovativeness among the vulnerable alongside
women. Despite the odds, they have been actively engaged in adaptation and mitigation




                                                                   O
initiatives that improve their communities’ resilience to climate change.
The conference therefore provided a platform for the African youths to interact and share best
practices. Five flagship projects were selected to be used as case studies by African Youths in
starting their own projects depending on transferability. The conference also saw the drafting of




                                                M
African youth position for COP 21 which was handed over to African Group of Negotiators at the
fifth Climate Change and Development in Africa Conference (CCDA V).

(AfriYOCC-2016)

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the environmental challenge of climate
change is already modifying Africa’s economies and livelihoods, health, social structure,
infrastructure and natural systems. Over the years, African youth have proved their potential in
both promoting and implementing climate change adaptation projects in their communities.
Their innovations have continually been adopted in responding to climate change impacts. This
is despite various challenges that include low capacity and education, high rates of poverty and
lack of financial resources. At the same time, African youth have been minimally represented in
the respective country policy processes as well as during the UNFCCC climate change
negotiations. Above 50% of the African population are the youth. This justifies the urgent need
for youth capacity development to respond to climate change and inclusion as key stakeholders
in policy process and negotiations. AYICC aims to spearhead new innovations, look into new
systems of success to share with policy and decision-makers, and generally aim to improve on
the current system which is causing long-term and irreversible degradation to our livelihoods –
as the leading youth organization on climate change in Africa.



                                                                    O
In cognizance of the role and potential of the African youth in climate change mitigation and
adaptation and overall sustainable development trajectory, the second African Youth




                                                 M
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC), shall be held in Nairobi, Kenya on 10th to 13th
October, 2016 as AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its formation in 2006 during the
second Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12. Building on the success of the first




                                               E
edition of conference, AfriYOCC shall provide an avenue for African youths to showcase their
climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, projects and initiatives. Best practices
arising from the various AYICC country chapters shall be developed to an African youth




                                    D
climate change adaptation and mitigation best practices database and handbook. The
meeting will dilate on the current post 2015 development agenda and the role of young
people in championing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in
Africa.

The delegates shall have an opportunity to visit ongoing Climate Change adaptation and
agribusiness projects in Kenya for hands-on skills and knowledge replicable in their countries.
Consequently, it shall boost the skills and capacities of African youths to substantially contribute
to the process leading towards and during COP 22. Through partnership with both
Governmental and Non-governmental agencies, the conference shall not only negotiate for
more youth representation in the respective country policy processes towards the forthcoming
CoPs and country specific policies, but also provide learning and engagement opportunities for
African youths. This will greatly enhance their current capacity and potential to actively
participate in both national and international platforms for policy formulation and implementation.
The conference will also provide a platform to re-assess the current position of our negotiators
and create awareness about the critical role young people should play in shifting agendas in the
forthcoming Conference of Parties in Marrakech come November 2016. While a 4 day gathering

issues affecting their livelihoods.

African youth have for long been side-lined to the periphery of the substantive civic and policy
issues facing the continent. However, the worst affected are the rural based youths and those
residing in farming communities, peri-urban areas and those from conflict and post conflict
countries. This has resulted in youths from these marginalized communities having no
knowledge and information on the basic climate change science and adaptation and mitigation
mechanisms. The good news though is that there is capacity amongst many young people who
are already in the circles of upcoming academia, policy specialists, lawyers, journalists and
scientists’ alike. These capacities need to be strengthened and skills shared amongst the wider
group of young people on the continent so that best practices are disseminated and resources
are expanded.

While it is an undeniable fact that climate change is affecting all regions globally, especially in
developing countries, the adverse effects in the future is likely to increase if the Paris agreement
is not ratified and effectuated by all parties. And even though a deal was achieved during
COP21 in Paris, the impacts of climate change will definitely continue into the future. This
suggests that young people will have to not just understand what climate change is and how it is




                                                                      O
affecting our world, opportunities that exists within, but most importantly, participate actively into
finding amicable solutions. Young people of Africa have therefore considered it an inherent
imperative to contribute to their future by organizing the 2nd African Youth Conference on
Climate Change in October 2016 under the theme, ‘Making Climate Finance work for




                                                  M
African Youth.’


2.1 CONFERENCE STRATEGY




                                                E
The conference program shall be based on exploring mechanisms to finance climate adaptation
and mitigation through Innovations in agriculture, technology and other sectors. It shall be




                                     D
highly interactive with unique workshop-style design that enables participants to develop their
potential through practical experience. Participants will divide to participate in thematic
workshops and come up with an African Youth position paper and concrete activities to be
included in the African Youth Strategy on Climate Change.

The delegates shall be engaged in pre-conference activities that shall include and not limited to,
mapping of youth climate change and/or mitigation projects within the conference key focus
areas for selection as best practice and include in the African youth climate change adaptation
and mitigation best practices database and handbook and aggressively fundraise towards their
participation and a successful workshop. The conference shall critically examine the various
country positions and the overall continents positions of the African Group of Negotiators, their
achievements and potentials towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It shall
examine the youth voices in these positions and further develop African youth position for
COP22.

We expect 200 youth leaders to participate in this conference. The conference is convened by
the AYICC continental secretariat in collaboration with AYICC Kenya chapter and the member

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is an umbrella youth network of African
based youth organizations, university groups, rural youth groups, schools, and individuals
working on climate change and sustainable development issues. It aims at developing capacity
and strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent need to take action
against the impacts of climate change for both present and future generations.

The initiative (always referred to as the movement) was conceived in Nairobi Kenya 10 years
ago, during the second Conference of Youth (COY2) preceding the 12th Conference of Parties
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC - COP12). The
main reason for its founding was to ensure the inclusion, and active participation of youths from
the south, and specifically Africa, in the international climate change negotiations. This was
needed as the youth are more than half the African population and are most affected by climate
change impacts. They also got massive potential to support the continent to take action on
global warming.

During its formation, it comprised of 8 country chapters and current has grown to 45 country
chapters with over 20,000 members across Africa and the Diaspora. This initiative has provided




                                                                  O
a platform for knowledge, ideas and experiences sharing. It is also an avenue for development
of skills and strategies on youth action on climate change mitigation and adaptation in the
African continent. AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a
platform for them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the




                                               M
UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others.

Since its inception, we have worked in partnership with international youth movements and have




                                             E
played a great role in the establishment of the International Youth Climate Movement whose
youth member organizations are now officially acknowledged by the UNFCCC as the YOUNGO
(Youth NGOs involved in the climate change negotiations process). Since COY2 in Nairobi, it




                                   D
has had youth delegates’ representation in all COP meetings.

In addition to the above, we have had landmark successes that include:
     A reach out programme for a children’s home (Watoto Wema in Ruai) and School
        climate change education program run in selected schools in Kenya.
     Leadership and mentorship programmes especially on volunteerism.
     Community development projects particularly on clean energy (energy saving stoves for
        rural folks)
     Capacity development of youth on agribusiness
     Advocacy campaigns e.g. lobbied for lanes to be set aside along the major highways for
        non-motorised transport especially for cyclists.
     Policy engagements i.e. contributing to the climate change bill 2012,as stakeholders
     Youth Caravan from Kenya to Durban during COP 17

African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) 2016

African Youth Conference on Climate Change will take place in Nairobi in Kenya. The conference is organized by the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change
(AYICC) and the African Climate Policy Centre from the 10 to 13 October 2016. AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its fonmation in 2006 during the second
Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12.

African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) www.ayicc.net is a continental youth network that was conceived in 2006 in Nairobi Kenya, during the
Conference of Youth held just before the UNFCCC COP12. This initiative has continued to link, and share knowledge, ideas, experiences, skills and strategies
on youth action around the continent on climate change, its mitigation and adaptation and sustainable development. In 2009, AYICC was granted observer
status to the African Minister Conference on Environment (AMCEN). AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a platform for
them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the Conference of Parties of UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others. AYICC
currently operates in over 45 African countries with over 20,000 members.

In response, to the call by AU Heads of Sates and Government to establish the CAHOSCC Youth Programme on Climate Change (CYPCC),

Founding Opportunities


AYICC Founding Opportunities

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the
environmental challenge of climate change will ultimately modify Africa's economies and livelihoods, health, social structure, infrastructure and natural
systems. To date little has been done to empower, capacitate and mobilise youth, particularly in Africa to address global environmental challenges such as
climate change. facebook d o w n ~ To remedy this, an initial step has been the formation of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC).

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change was formed partially in response to the poor representation of young Africans at the International Youth
Summit on Climate Change (November 24-28, 2005), which was held in conjunction with the United Nation's Climate Change Conference (November 28-
December 10, 2005) in Montreal , Canada. The overall mission of AYICC is to ensure that African youth are equipped toparticipate in future UNFCCC
meetings and other global initiatives for sustainable solutions to environmental degradation and climate change.

In order to ensure a strong youth presence in climate change dialogue and fora, there is a need for AYICC to ensure youth representation from various parts
of Africa. This will enable Africa's youth to engage with the global youth movement, governments and NGO's in a more coordinated and sustained manner.
The long term goal is to ensure sustainable and systematic global youth action, with special emphasis on African youth on the issue of climate change.

Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any financial assistance. The planning committee members have
volunteered their time and their contributions. However, in order to make this vision a reality we need to become a financially viable organisation. For this
reason, we would like to request your financial assistance in getting this vision off the ground.•

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE ADF 7 OPENING FORUM, 12TH OCT.10

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE OPENING FORUM OF THE SEVENTH AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FORUM, 12TH OCTOBER

2010: Ms. Esther Agbarakwe, Nigeria




The Chair,

Climate Change poses significant challenges to future generations. As youth we have a stake in this future; it is our future.




                                                                                                                 O
As the 7th African Development Forum, we have indeed come of age, we are no longer in our childhood stages of determining sustainable development - the
time of maturity has arrived. This year is marked as the International Year of Youth and now, more than ever before, the youth are taking a stand. More than
anyone else, we, the Youth, face unprecedented challenges as a result of global climate change. We also share the responsibility of addressing ii. As a group,
we are key moral stakeholders in the international processes treating the most important challenge of our generation. As it is our future, we will be
disproportionately affected by the catastrophic impacts of climate change.

Advocacy and Behavior Change: II is critical for present and future leaders to collaborate on finding solutions. The need for cultural transformation in our time




                                                                              M
is stronger than ever. This transformation - that enables us to shift towards a more sustainable world - should be an organic process, guided by principles of
compassion, integrity and justice. We need to pragmatically rethink our behavioral patterns, to enable a paradigm shift that is based on an ongoing process of
action, reflection and meaningful participation. Awareness, education and empowerment are fundamental prerequisites to enabling this process, and the youth
are energetic and passionate about holding governments and all relevant stakeholders involved accountable for their actions. We are equal partners in this
process and commit ourselves fully to achieving the objectives as decided by this Forum.




                                                                            E
Contrary to what is believed; young people play a dynamic role in framing and implementing policies. So their role goes beyond advocacy. From an advocacy
perspective, young people are involved in songs and stories which spread awareness in local languages. Of course we understand the importance and
relevance of this because 70% of Africa is based in rural areas and the term Climate Change is foreign, Young people are finding ways of using words in local
languages to translate the message across.




                                                           D
It is time to shift the balance of decision-making towards the generation that will have to manage this unwanted inheritance, to make political and economic
decisions that can span a generation, and to enable real inter-generational and inter-cultural dialogue about climate change to be realized in institutions where
the youth generation can learn.

However at the same time a range of social learning and marketing approaches need to be developed to address the gap between classroom education styles
and education that stimulates real action. This gap prevents the cultural shift from token awareness to personal action and reaction.

Education: In relation to climate change, African Governments should begin at inception to mainstream youth voices and perceptions. This is particularly
important because climate change projections indicate that effects will begin to be most felt in the next 20-30 years - young people should begin to be part of
the solution so that they will be able to cope when disaster calls. Involving them in this programme will ensure that those who will be affected will have direct
knowledge of the challenges and strategies for coping as well as the ability to mobilize communities to respond to and prepare for the impact of climate change
and natural disasters.

Governments must give credence to the higher learning education system in Africa in particular the increased accent on improvement of research and
innovation on climate change specifically highlighting on policy and reform, the programmes, pedagogy and teaching tools. This will enhance an equipped pool
of intellectual capital among the young people on climate change issues who will replicate this to the various organizations and networks that they are part of.

Al government level, during the last Conference of the Parties (COP), ii was pleasing to see that many African delegations included youth and gave them a role
to play. Furthermore, many youth who were involved in COP 15 deliberations have been interacting with their various governments and engaging in processes
and procedures that are related to Climate change policy. There is an understanding that more needs to be done, and at this forum, I urge you to engage young
people who knock on your doors asking to be involved.

Youth and youth based NGOs play a major role either in strengthening local capacity to cope or by supporting local action. Already, groups such as the Nigerian
Youth Coalition and the African youth Climate Initiative-Kenya have established school climate clubs, which are creative ways to engage young people; these
initiatives should be mainstreamed into education systems. Young people in this governance process are important because successful adaptation requires a
host of innovative measures developed with vulnerable communities to improve their present and future livelihoods. Young people are vibrant and are able to
access places that many governmental institutions fail to access. As the majority of the population and Africa's future, it is important to include them in this
impending crisis that is Climate Change.

Already, this conference calls for integrated approaches to enable African countries to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change. There is a dire need
to have a clearer understanding of the potential calamities that climate change can bring and to start the discourse on how best to stave off the worst impacts.
There is already an understanding that

Climate Change is not a localized problem but transcends national borders, hence the need for co-operation of Intergovernmental agencies but also to include
those young and vulnerable people.

Conclusion :
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS035_AndelaTechnicalLeadershipProgram","No longer can climate change be seen as merely an environmental problem or an energy challenge. It is a combination of both, which needs the involvement of
young people to preserve the environment and enter into green energy careers.

It's important for all of us to recognize that sustainable development isn't just a catch phrase - people all over the continent are taking it into their own hands. A
couple days ago over 300 community events took place in nearly every country on the continent of Africa, and more than 7000 globally as part of the Global
Work Party on 10/10/10.

Everywhere in the wortd, people planted trees, cultivated community gardens, installed solar panels, made buildings more efficient and implemented thousands
of other grassroots solutions to the climate crisis. We got to work everywhere in the world, but we need you, leaders, to get to work, too.

Thank you and God bless

                        African Youth at COP25

                        by ayicc_admin · Published May 20, 2020 · Updated May 20, 2020

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS035_AndelaTechnicalLeadershipProgram","The 25th session of the Conference Parties (COP25) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held from the 2 -13
December bringing together nearly 27000 people to the Spanish capital. COP25
provided parties with the opportunity to finalize the ""rulebook"" of the Paris
Agreement - the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020.


In the spirit of the convention on climate change young people continue to enjoy




                                                                          O
various spaces during COP mainly through YOU NGO; the official youth
constituency to the UNFCCC. Article 6 ofthe Convention and Article 12 of the
Paris Agreement referred to as Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) encourage
the empowerment of every member of the society to take climate actions and
therefore young people who are most vulnerable to the climate crisis are




                                             M
increasingly becoming the centre of discussion.


The world today is home to the largest generation of young people in history and
their energy, creativity, and innovation, when harnessed properly, will accelerate




                                           E
sustainable solutions to the global crisis. Youth have a pivotal role to play in the
implementation of ACE which consists of six elements namely: education,
training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and
international cooperation.




                             D
At COP25, the Intergenerational Inquiry which is a highlight event of Young and
Future Generations Day and like every year provided a platform for youth and
decision-makers to discuss how young people can enhance the implementation
of the Paris Agreement. This platform was attended by the Executive Secretary of
the UNFCCC and provided an opportunity for young people to share the
outcome on the Conference of Youth (COY 15) to the secretariat.


The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) has continued to
empower and mobilize young people at COP through our side events and
exhibitions. Through an exhibition at COP 25, AYICC was able to showcase the
actions and contributions of African youth in the fight against climate change.
Such actions include ecological restorations, renewable energy promotion, and
local conference of youth hosted by our national chapters.


AYICC's greatest concern however, is with regards to the low representation of
African youth at the UNFCCC sessions. There are many contributing factors which
includes lack of funding, inability to assess accreditations and visas. As the first
step in addressing this, we will continue to encourage African countries to make
conscious efforts to include youth delegates in their official delegations for COPs.
We also call on development partners and stakeholders who are interested in
youth development to reach out with their support to AYICC to enhance African
youth participation in this important global process.

Climate Change


• Campaigns and Advocacy
 The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is widely known for our
 incessant campaigns and research-based advocacy on environmental and
 climate change topics. Since 2006 AYICC has been consistent with its
 campaigns impressing on African governments and international community
 alike to deliver on their commitment under the United Nations Framework
 Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) .



• Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)
 Climate change education, training, and awareness creation have been the
 central focus of AYICC targeting youth and vulnerable communities. We do
 this through workshops, conferences, and webinars leveraging on our robust
 online presence. Through our Flagship program; the African Youth Conference
 on Climate Change (AFRIYOCC) we are able to provide a platform for




                                                                     O
 exchange of ideas and sharing of knowledge and best practices among young
 African thereby feeding into article 6 of the climate change convention and
 article 12 of the Paris Agreement.



• Tree planting and Ecological restoration



                                         M
 Trees contribute to their environment by providing oxygen, improving air
 quality, climate amelioration, conserving water, preserving soil, and




                                       E
 supporting wildlife. Beyond the campaigns and advocacies, our member
 organizations embark on tree planting and reforestation activities including
 mangrove restoration along the coast.

• Renewable energy promotion
 With the increasing demand for energy for industrial and economic
 development, AYICC member organizations in different countries are
 promoting renewable energy access to isolated off-grid communities. AYICC
 believes that Youth-led renewable energy enterprises are a viable means of
 achieving sustainable development, as they promote technologies that are
 less harmful to the global environs while at the same time providing
 sustainable income-generating opportunities for youth .



• Youth in Agribusiness
 AYICC sees agriculture as an essential driver of economic development and an
 area of great opportunity for young people in Africa. The challenge, however,
 is that the growing youth population does not see agriculture as a profitable
 opportunity due to their lack of insight into the opportunities that exist within
 the agriculture value chain. Through our member organizations who are youth
 farmers themselves, AYICC has adopted various strategies including outreach
 to schools and communities, exhibitions and youth agricultural festivals as
 well as institution of award schemes for best youth farmers as a way to raise
 interest and awareness on the opportunities that exist within this sector.

                            products as a by-product of the increasing level of population, affluence, and
                            technological advancement in a given environment or society. In Africa we
                            have witnessed increasing level of pollution from plastic, car tires, bottles
                            among others and this has generated innovative thinking among young
                            people to provide a sustainable solution. Over the years, AYICC members have
                            redefined waste as a resource for sustainable development and through
                            various recycling initiatives, they are bringing life into materials that otherwise
                            could have been a nuisance to the environment.

The 1st African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) convened from 26th - 27th
October, 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, on the theme “African Youth Responses to Climate
Change and Food Security, Action from the Frontline.” The conference was organized by Africa
Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) in partnership with Africa Climate Policy Center
(ACPC), New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), Pan African Climate Justice
Alliance (PACJA) and Zimbabwe United Nations Association (ZUNA).
100 youths selected across Africa in the conference addressing the thematic strands of Youth in
Agribusiness; Climate Change and Development in Africa; Sustainable Agriculture and Food
Security; Green Economy and Technology Transfer; Climate Justice and Human Rights; and
Climate Change and Disaster risk reduction participated in this first edition of the African Youth
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC). This came at a time when Africa as a continent
continues to bear the biggest brunt of climate change due to low resilience and weak capacities,
with the youth despite their huge numbers and innovativeness among the vulnerable alongside
women. Despite the odds, they have been actively engaged in adaptation and mitigation




                                                                   O
initiatives that improve their communities’ resilience to climate change.
The conference therefore provided a platform for the African youths to interact and share best
practices. Five flagship projects were selected to be used as case studies by African Youths in
starting their own projects depending on transferability. The conference also saw the drafting of




                                                M
African youth position for COP 21 which was handed over to African Group of Negotiators at the
fifth Climate Change and Development in Africa Conference (CCDA V).

(AfriYOCC-2016)

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the environmental challenge of climate
change is already modifying Africa’s economies and livelihoods, health, social structure,
infrastructure and natural systems. Over the years, African youth have proved their potential in
both promoting and implementing climate change adaptation projects in their communities.
Their innovations have continually been adopted in responding to climate change impacts. This
is despite various challenges that include low capacity and education, high rates of poverty and
lack of financial resources. At the same time, African youth have been minimally represented in
the respective country policy processes as well as during the UNFCCC climate change
negotiations. Above 50% of the African population are the youth. This justifies the urgent need
for youth capacity development to respond to climate change and inclusion as key stakeholders
in policy process and negotiations. AYICC aims to spearhead new innovations, look into new
systems of success to share with policy and decision-makers, and generally aim to improve on
the current system which is causing long-term and irreversible degradation to our livelihoods –
as the leading youth organization on climate change in Africa.



                                                                    O
In cognizance of the role and potential of the African youth in climate change mitigation and
adaptation and overall sustainable development trajectory, the second African Youth

Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC), shall be held in Nairobi, Kenya on 10th to 13th
October, 2016 as AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its formation in 2006 during the
second Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12. Building on the success of the first




                                               E
edition of conference, AfriYOCC shall provide an avenue for African youths to showcase their
climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, projects and initiatives. Best practices
arising from the various AYICC country chapters shall be developed to an African youth




                                    D
climate change adaptation and mitigation best practices database and handbook. The
meeting will dilate on the current post 2015 development agenda and the role of young
people in championing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in
Africa.

The delegates shall have an opportunity to visit ongoing Climate Change adaptation and
agribusiness projects in Kenya for hands-on skills and knowledge replicable in their countries.
Consequently, it shall boost the skills and capacities of African youths to substantially contribute
to the process leading towards and during COP 22. Through partnership with both
Governmental and Non-governmental agencies, the conference shall not only negotiate for
more youth representation in the respective country policy processes towards the forthcoming
CoPs and country specific policies, but also provide learning and engagement opportunities for
African youths. This will greatly enhance their current capacity and potential to actively
participate in both national and international platforms for policy formulation and implementation.
The conference will also provide a platform to re-assess the current position of our negotiators
and create awareness about the critical role young people should play in shifting agendas in the
forthcoming Conference of Parties in Marrakech come November 2016. While a 4 day gathering

issues affecting their livelihoods.

African youth have for long been side-lined to the periphery of the substantive civic and policy
issues facing the continent. However, the worst affected are the rural based youths and those
residing in farming communities, peri-urban areas and those from conflict and post conflict
countries. This has resulted in youths from these marginalized communities having no
knowledge and information on the basic climate change science and adaptation and mitigation
mechanisms. The good news though is that there is capacity amongst many young people who
are already in the circles of upcoming academia, policy specialists, lawyers, journalists and
scientists’ alike. These capacities need to be strengthened and skills shared amongst the wider
group of young people on the continent so that best practices are disseminated and resources
are expanded.

While it is an undeniable fact that climate change is affecting all regions globally, especially in
developing countries, the adverse effects in the future is likely to increase if the Paris agreement
is not ratified and effectuated by all parties. And even though a deal was achieved during
COP21 in Paris, the impacts of climate change will definitely continue into the future. This
suggests that young people will have to not just understand what climate change is and how it is




                                                                      O
affecting our world, opportunities that exists within, but most importantly, participate actively into
finding amicable solutions. Young people of Africa have therefore considered it an inherent
imperative to contribute to their future by organizing the 2nd African Youth Conference on
Climate Change in October 2016 under the theme, ‘Making Climate Finance work for




                                                  M
African Youth.’


2.1 CONFERENCE STRATEGY




                                                E
The conference program shall be based on exploring mechanisms to finance climate adaptation
and mitigation through Innovations in agriculture, technology and other sectors. It shall be




                                     D
highly interactive with unique workshop-style design that enables participants to develop their
potential through practical experience. Participants will divide to participate in thematic
workshops and come up with an African Youth position paper and concrete activities to be
included in the African Youth Strategy on Climate Change.

The delegates shall be engaged in pre-conference activities that shall include and not limited to,
mapping of youth climate change and/or mitigation projects within the conference key focus
areas for selection as best practice and include in the African youth climate change adaptation
and mitigation best practices database and handbook and aggressively fundraise towards their
participation and a successful workshop. The conference shall critically examine the various
country positions and the overall continents positions of the African Group of Negotiators, their
achievements and potentials towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It shall
examine the youth voices in these positions and further develop African youth position for
COP22.

We expect 200 youth leaders to participate in this conference. The conference is convened by
the AYICC continental secretariat in collaboration with AYICC Kenya chapter and the member

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is an umbrella youth network of African
based youth organizations, university groups, rural youth groups, schools, and individuals
working on climate change and sustainable development issues. It aims at developing capacity
and strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent need to take action
against the impacts of climate change for both present and future generations.

The initiative (always referred to as the movement) was conceived in Nairobi Kenya 10 years
ago, during the second Conference of Youth (COY2) preceding the 12th Conference of Parties
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC - COP12). The
main reason for its founding was to ensure the inclusion, and active participation of youths from
the south, and specifically Africa, in the international climate change negotiations. This was
needed as the youth are more than half the African population and are most affected by climate
change impacts. They also got massive potential to support the continent to take action on
global warming.

During its formation, it comprised of 8 country chapters and current has grown to 45 country
chapters with over 20,000 members across Africa and the Diaspora. This initiative has provided




                                                                  O
a platform for knowledge, ideas and experiences sharing. It is also an avenue for development
of skills and strategies on youth action on climate change mitigation and adaptation in the
African continent. AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a
platform for them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the




                                               M
UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others.

Since its inception, we have worked in partnership with international youth movements and have




                                             E
played a great role in the establishment of the International Youth Climate Movement whose
youth member organizations are now officially acknowledged by the UNFCCC as the YOUNGO
(Youth NGOs involved in the climate change negotiations process). Since COY2 in Nairobi, it




                                   D
has had youth delegates’ representation in all COP meetings.

In addition to the above, we have had landmark successes that include:
     A reach out programme for a children’s home (Watoto Wema in Ruai) and School
        climate change education program run in selected schools in Kenya.
     Leadership and mentorship programmes especially on volunteerism.
     Community development projects particularly on clean energy (energy saving stoves for
        rural folks)
     Capacity development of youth on agribusiness
     Advocacy campaigns e.g. lobbied for lanes to be set aside along the major highways for
        non-motorised transport especially for cyclists.
     Policy engagements i.e. contributing to the climate change bill 2012,as stakeholders
     Youth Caravan from Kenya to Durban during COP 17

African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) www.ayicc.net is a continental youth network that was conceived in 2006 in Nairobi Kenya, during the
Conference of Youth held just before the UNFCCC COP12. This initiative has continued to link, and share knowledge, ideas, experiences, skills and strategies
on youth action around the continent on climate change, its mitigation and adaptation and sustainable development. In 2009, AYICC was granted observer
status to the African Minister Conference on Environment (AMCEN). AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a platform for
them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the Conference of Parties of UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others. AYICC
currently operates in over 45 African countries with over 20,000 members.

In response, to the call by AU Heads of Sates and Government to establish the CAHOSCC Youth Programme on Climate Change (CYPCC),

Founding Opportunities


AYICC Founding Opportunities

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the
environmental challenge of climate change will ultimately modify Africa's economies and livelihoods, health, social structure, infrastructure and natural
systems. To date little has been done to empower, capacitate and mobilise youth, particularly in Africa to address global environmental challenges such as
climate change. facebook d o w n ~ To remedy this, an initial step has been the formation of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC).

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change was formed partially in response to the poor representation of young Africans at the International Youth
Summit on Climate Change (November 24-28, 2005), which was held in conjunction with the United Nation's Climate Change Conference (November 28-
December 10, 2005) in Montreal , Canada. The overall mission of AYICC is to ensure that African youth are equipped toparticipate in future UNFCCC
meetings and other global initiatives for sustainable solutions to environmental degradation and climate change.

In order to ensure a strong youth presence in climate change dialogue and fora, there is a need for AYICC to ensure youth representation from various parts
of Africa. This will enable Africa's youth to engage with the global youth movement, governments and NGO's in a more coordinated and sustained manner.
The long term goal is to ensure sustainable and systematic global youth action, with special emphasis on African youth on the issue of climate change.

Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any financial assistance. The planning committee members have
volunteered their time and their contributions. However, in order to make this vision a reality we need to become a financially viable organisation. For this
reason, we would like to request your financial assistance in getting this vision off the ground.•

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE ADF 7 OPENING FORUM, 12TH OCT.10

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE OPENING FORUM OF THE SEVENTH AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FORUM, 12TH OCTOBER

2010: Ms. Esther Agbarakwe, Nigeria




The Chair,

Climate Change poses significant challenges to future generations. As youth we have a stake in this future; it is our future.




                                                                                                                 O
As the 7th African Development Forum, we have indeed come of age, we are no longer in our childhood stages of determining sustainable development - the
time of maturity has arrived. This year is marked as the International Year of Youth and now, more than ever before, the youth are taking a stand. More than
anyone else, we, the Youth, face unprecedented challenges as a result of global climate change. We also share the responsibility of addressing ii. As a group,
we are key moral stakeholders in the international processes treating the most important challenge of our generation. As it is our future, we will be
disproportionately affected by the catastrophic impacts of climate change.

Advocacy and Behavior Change: II is critical for present and future leaders to collaborate on finding solutions. The need for cultural transformation in our time




                                                                              M
is stronger than ever. This transformation - that enables us to shift towards a more sustainable world - should be an organic process, guided by principles of
compassion, integrity and justice. We need to pragmatically rethink our behavioral patterns, to enable a paradigm shift that is based on an ongoing process of
action, reflection and meaningful participation. Awareness, education and empowerment are fundamental prerequisites to enabling this process, and the youth
are energetic and passionate about holding governments and all relevant stakeholders involved accountable for their actions. We are equal partners in this
process and commit ourselves fully to achieving the objectives as decided by this Forum.




                                                                            E
Contrary to what is believed; young people play a dynamic role in framing and implementing policies. So their role goes beyond advocacy. From an advocacy
perspective, young people are involved in songs and stories which spread awareness in local languages. Of course we understand the importance and
relevance of this because 70% of Africa is based in rural areas and the term Climate Change is foreign, Young people are finding ways of using words in local
languages to translate the message across.




                                                           D
It is time to shift the balance of decision-making towards the generation that will have to manage this unwanted inheritance, to make political and economic
decisions that can span a generation, and to enable real inter-generational and inter-cultural dialogue about climate change to be realized in institutions where
the youth generation can learn.

However at the same time a range of social learning and marketing approaches need to be developed to address the gap between classroom education styles
and education that stimulates real action. This gap prevents the cultural shift from token awareness to personal action and reaction.

Education: In relation to climate change, African Governments should begin at inception to mainstream youth voices and perceptions. This is particularly
important because climate change projections indicate that effects will begin to be most felt in the next 20-30 years - young people should begin to be part of
the solution so that they will be able to cope when disaster calls. Involving them in this programme will ensure that those who will be affected will have direct
knowledge of the challenges and strategies for coping as well as the ability to mobilize communities to respond to and prepare for the impact of climate change
and natural disasters.

Governments must give credence to the higher learning education system in Africa in particular the increased accent on improvement of research and
innovation on climate change specifically highlighting on policy and reform, the programmes, pedagogy and teaching tools. This will enhance an equipped pool
of intellectual capital among the young people on climate change issues who will replicate this to the various organizations and networks that they are part of.

Al government level, during the last Conference of the Parties (COP), ii was pleasing to see that many African delegations included youth and gave them a role
to play. Furthermore, many youth who were involved in COP 15 deliberations have been interacting with their various governments and engaging in processes
and procedures that are related to Climate change policy. There is an understanding that more needs to be done, and at this forum, I urge you to engage young
people who knock on your doors asking to be involved.

Youth and youth based NGOs play a major role either in strengthening local capacity to cope or by supporting local action. Already, groups such as the Nigerian
Youth Coalition and the African youth Climate Initiative-Kenya have established school climate clubs, which are creative ways to engage young people; these
initiatives should be mainstreamed into education systems. Young people in this governance process are important because successful adaptation requires a
host of innovative measures developed with vulnerable communities to improve their present and future livelihoods. Young people are vibrant and are able to
access places that many governmental institutions fail to access. As the majority of the population and Africa's future, it is important to include them in this
impending crisis that is Climate Change.

Already, this conference calls for integrated approaches to enable African countries to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change. There is a dire need
to have a clearer understanding of the potential calamities that climate change can bring and to start the discourse on how best to stave off the worst impacts.
There is already an understanding that

Climate Change is not a localized problem but transcends national borders, hence the need for co-operation of Intergovernmental agencies but also to include
those young and vulnerable people.

Conclusion :
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS045EmergingLeadersFoundation","No longer can climate change be seen as merely an environmental problem or an energy challenge. It is a combination of both, which needs the involvement of
young people to preserve the environment and enter into green energy careers.

It's important for all of us to recognize that sustainable development isn't just a catch phrase - people all over the continent are taking it into their own hands. A
couple days ago over 300 community events took place in nearly every country on the continent of Africa, and more than 7000 globally as part of the Global
Work Party on 10/10/10.

Everywhere in the wortd, people planted trees, cultivated community gardens, installed solar panels, made buildings more efficient and implemented thousands
of other grassroots solutions to the climate crisis. We got to work everywhere in the world, but we need you, leaders, to get to work, too.

Thank you and God bless

                        African Youth at COP25

                        by ayicc_admin · Published May 20, 2020 · Updated May 20, 2020
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS045EmergingLeadersFoundation","The 25th session of the Conference Parties (COP25) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held from the 2 -13
December bringing together nearly 27000 people to the Spanish capital. COP25
provided parties with the opportunity to finalize the ""rulebook"" of the Paris
Agreement - the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020.


In the spirit of the convention on climate change young people continue to enjoy




                                                                          O
various spaces during COP mainly through YOU NGO; the official youth
constituency to the UNFCCC. Article 6 ofthe Convention and Article 12 of the
Paris Agreement referred to as Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) encourage
the empowerment of every member of the society to take climate actions and
therefore young people who are most vulnerable to the climate crisis are




                                             M
increasingly becoming the centre of discussion.


The world today is home to the largest generation of young people in history and
their energy, creativity, and innovation, when harnessed properly, will accelerate




                                           E
sustainable solutions to the global crisis. Youth have a pivotal role to play in the
implementation of ACE which consists of six elements namely: education,
training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and
international cooperation.




                             D
At COP25, the Intergenerational Inquiry which is a highlight event of Young and
Future Generations Day and like every year provided a platform for youth and
decision-makers to discuss how young people can enhance the implementation
of the Paris Agreement. This platform was attended by the Executive Secretary of
the UNFCCC and provided an opportunity for young people to share the
outcome on the Conference of Youth (COY 15) to the secretariat.


The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) has continued to
empower and mobilize young people at COP through our side events and
exhibitions. Through an exhibition at COP 25, AYICC was able to showcase the
actions and contributions of African youth in the fight against climate change.
Such actions include ecological restorations, renewable energy promotion, and
local conference of youth hosted by our national chapters.


AYICC's greatest concern however, is with regards to the low representation of
African youth at the UNFCCC sessions. There are many contributing factors which
includes lack of funding, inability to assess accreditations and visas. As the first
step in addressing this, we will continue to encourage African countries to make
conscious efforts to include youth delegates in their official delegations for COPs.
We also call on development partners and stakeholders who are interested in
youth development to reach out with their support to AYICC to enhance African
youth participation in this important global process.

Climate Change


• Campaigns and Advocacy
 The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is widely known for our
 incessant campaigns and research-based advocacy on environmental and
 climate change topics. Since 2006 AYICC has been consistent with its
 campaigns impressing on African governments and international community
 alike to deliver on their commitment under the United Nations Framework
 Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) .



• Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)
 Climate change education, training, and awareness creation have been the
 central focus of AYICC targeting youth and vulnerable communities. We do
 this through workshops, conferences, and webinars leveraging on our robust
 online presence. Through our Flagship program; the African Youth Conference
 on Climate Change (AFRIYOCC) we are able to provide a platform for




                                                                     O
 exchange of ideas and sharing of knowledge and best practices among young
 African thereby feeding into article 6 of the climate change convention and
 article 12 of the Paris Agreement.



• Tree planting and Ecological restoration



                                         M
 Trees contribute to their environment by providing oxygen, improving air
 quality, climate amelioration, conserving water, preserving soil, and




                                       E
 supporting wildlife. Beyond the campaigns and advocacies, our member
 organizations embark on tree planting and reforestation activities including
 mangrove restoration along the coast.




                         D
• Renewable energy promotion
 With the increasing demand for energy for industrial and economic
 development, AYICC member organizations in different countries are
 promoting renewable energy access to isolated off-grid communities. AYICC
 believes that Youth-led renewable energy enterprises are a viable means of
 achieving sustainable development, as they promote technologies that are
 less harmful to the global environs while at the same time providing
 sustainable income-generating opportunities for youth .



• Youth in Agribusiness
 AYICC sees agriculture as an essential driver of economic development and an
 area of great opportunity for young people in Africa. The challenge, however,
 is that the growing youth population does not see agriculture as a profitable
 opportunity due to their lack of insight into the opportunities that exist within
 the agriculture value chain. Through our member organizations who are youth
 farmers themselves, AYICC has adopted various strategies including outreach
 to schools and communities, exhibitions and youth agricultural festivals as
 well as institution of award schemes for best youth farmers as a way to raise
 interest and awareness on the opportunities that exist within this sector.



• Recycling

                            products as a by-product of the increasing level of population, affluence, and
                            technological advancement in a given environment or society. In Africa we
                            have witnessed increasing level of pollution from plastic, car tires, bottles
                            among others and this has generated innovative thinking among young
                            people to provide a sustainable solution. Over the years, AYICC members have
                            redefined waste as a resource for sustainable development and through
                            various recycling initiatives, they are bringing life into materials that otherwise
                            could have been a nuisance to the environment.

The 1st African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) convened from 26th - 27th
October, 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, on the theme “African Youth Responses to Climate
Change and Food Security, Action from the Frontline.” The conference was organized by Africa
Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) in partnership with Africa Climate Policy Center
(ACPC), New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), Pan African Climate Justice
Alliance (PACJA) and Zimbabwe United Nations Association (ZUNA).
100 youths selected across Africa in the conference addressing the thematic strands of Youth in
Agribusiness; Climate Change and Development in Africa; Sustainable Agriculture and Food
Security; Green Economy and Technology Transfer; Climate Justice and Human Rights; and
Climate Change and Disaster risk reduction participated in this first edition of the African Youth
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC). This came at a time when Africa as a continent
continues to bear the biggest brunt of climate change due to low resilience and weak capacities,
with the youth despite their huge numbers and innovativeness among the vulnerable alongside
women. Despite the odds, they have been actively engaged in adaptation and mitigation




                                                                   O
initiatives that improve their communities’ resilience to climate change.
The conference therefore provided a platform for the African youths to interact and share best
practices. Five flagship projects were selected to be used as case studies by African Youths in
starting their own projects depending on transferability. The conference also saw the drafting of




                                                M
African youth position for COP 21 which was handed over to African Group of Negotiators at the
fifth Climate Change and Development in Africa Conference (CCDA V).

(AfriYOCC-2016)

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the environmental challenge of climate
change is already modifying Africa’s economies and livelihoods, health, social structure,
infrastructure and natural systems. Over the years, African youth have proved their potential in
both promoting and implementing climate change adaptation projects in their communities.
Their innovations have continually been adopted in responding to climate change impacts. This
is despite various challenges that include low capacity and education, high rates of poverty and
lack of financial resources. At the same time, African youth have been minimally represented in
the respective country policy processes as well as during the UNFCCC climate change
negotiations. Above 50% of the African population are the youth. This justifies the urgent need
for youth capacity development to respond to climate change and inclusion as key stakeholders
in policy process and negotiations. AYICC aims to spearhead new innovations, look into new
systems of success to share with policy and decision-makers, and generally aim to improve on
the current system which is causing long-term and irreversible degradation to our livelihoods –
as the leading youth organization on climate change in Africa.



                                                                    O
In cognizance of the role and potential of the African youth in climate change mitigation and
adaptation and overall sustainable development trajectory, the second African Youth

Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC), shall be held in Nairobi, Kenya on 10th to 13th
October, 2016 as AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its formation in 2006 during the
second Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12. Building on the success of the first




                                               E
edition of conference, AfriYOCC shall provide an avenue for African youths to showcase their
climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, projects and initiatives. Best practices
arising from the various AYICC country chapters shall be developed to an African youth




                                    D
climate change adaptation and mitigation best practices database and handbook. The
meeting will dilate on the current post 2015 development agenda and the role of young
people in championing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in
Africa.

The delegates shall have an opportunity to visit ongoing Climate Change adaptation and
agribusiness projects in Kenya for hands-on skills and knowledge replicable in their countries.
Consequently, it shall boost the skills and capacities of African youths to substantially contribute
to the process leading towards and during COP 22. Through partnership with both
Governmental and Non-governmental agencies, the conference shall not only negotiate for
more youth representation in the respective country policy processes towards the forthcoming
CoPs and country specific policies, but also provide learning and engagement opportunities for
African youths. This will greatly enhance their current capacity and potential to actively
participate in both national and international platforms for policy formulation and implementation.
The conference will also provide a platform to re-assess the current position of our negotiators
and create awareness about the critical role young people should play in shifting agendas in the
forthcoming Conference of Parties in Marrakech come November 2016. While a 4 day gathering

issues affecting their livelihoods.

African youth have for long been side-lined to the periphery of the substantive civic and policy
issues facing the continent. However, the worst affected are the rural based youths and those
residing in farming communities, peri-urban areas and those from conflict and post conflict
countries. This has resulted in youths from these marginalized communities having no
knowledge and information on the basic climate change science and adaptation and mitigation
mechanisms. The good news though is that there is capacity amongst many young people who
are already in the circles of upcoming academia, policy specialists, lawyers, journalists and
scientists’ alike. These capacities need to be strengthened and skills shared amongst the wider
group of young people on the continent so that best practices are disseminated and resources
are expanded.

While it is an undeniable fact that climate change is affecting all regions globally, especially in
developing countries, the adverse effects in the future is likely to increase if the Paris agreement
is not ratified and effectuated by all parties. And even though a deal was achieved during
COP21 in Paris, the impacts of climate change will definitely continue into the future. This
suggests that young people will have to not just understand what climate change is and how it is




                                                                      O
affecting our world, opportunities that exists within, but most importantly, participate actively into
finding amicable solutions. Young people of Africa have therefore considered it an inherent
imperative to contribute to their future by organizing the 2nd African Youth Conference on
Climate Change in October 2016 under the theme, ‘Making Climate Finance work for




                                                  M
African Youth.’


2.1 CONFERENCE STRATEGY




                                                E
The conference program shall be based on exploring mechanisms to finance climate adaptation
and mitigation through Innovations in agriculture, technology and other sectors. It shall be




                                     D
highly interactive with unique workshop-style design that enables participants to develop their
potential through practical experience. Participants will divide to participate in thematic
workshops and come up with an African Youth position paper and concrete activities to be
included in the African Youth Strategy on Climate Change.

The delegates shall be engaged in pre-conference activities that shall include and not limited to,
mapping of youth climate change and/or mitigation projects within the conference key focus
areas for selection as best practice and include in the African youth climate change adaptation
and mitigation best practices database and handbook and aggressively fundraise towards their
participation and a successful workshop. The conference shall critically examine the various
country positions and the overall continents positions of the African Group of Negotiators, their
achievements and potentials towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It shall
examine the youth voices in these positions and further develop African youth position for
COP22.

We expect 200 youth leaders to participate in this conference. The conference is convened by
the AYICC continental secretariat in collaboration with AYICC Kenya chapter and the member

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is an umbrella youth network of African
based youth organizations, university groups, rural youth groups, schools, and individuals
working on climate change and sustainable development issues. It aims at developing capacity
and strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent need to take action
against the impacts of climate change for both present and future generations.

The initiative (always referred to as the movement) was conceived in Nairobi Kenya 10 years
ago, during the second Conference of Youth (COY2) preceding the 12th Conference of Parties
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC - COP12). The
main reason for its founding was to ensure the inclusion, and active participation of youths from
the south, and specifically Africa, in the international climate change negotiations. This was
needed as the youth are more than half the African population and are most affected by climate
change impacts. They also got massive potential to support the continent to take action on
global warming.

During its formation, it comprised of 8 country chapters and current has grown to 45 country
chapters with over 20,000 members across Africa and the Diaspora. This initiative has provided




                                                                  O
a platform for knowledge, ideas and experiences sharing. It is also an avenue for development
of skills and strategies on youth action on climate change mitigation and adaptation in the
African continent. AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a
platform for them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the




                                               M
UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others.

Since its inception, we have worked in partnership with international youth movements and have




                                             E
played a great role in the establishment of the International Youth Climate Movement whose
youth member organizations are now officially acknowledged by the UNFCCC as the YOUNGO
(Youth NGOs involved in the climate change negotiations process). Since COY2 in Nairobi, it




                                   D
has had youth delegates’ representation in all COP meetings.

In addition to the above, we have had landmark successes that include:
     A reach out programme for a children’s home (Watoto Wema in Ruai) and School
        climate change education program run in selected schools in Kenya.
     Leadership and mentorship programmes especially on volunteerism.
     Community development projects particularly on clean energy (energy saving stoves for
        rural folks)
     Capacity development of youth on agribusiness
     Advocacy campaigns e.g. lobbied for lanes to be set aside along the major highways for
        non-motorised transport especially for cyclists.
     Policy engagements i.e. contributing to the climate change bill 2012,as stakeholders
     Youth Caravan from Kenya to Durban during COP 17

Conference of Youth held just before the UNFCCC COP12. This initiative has continued to link, and share knowledge, ideas, experiences, skills and strategies
on youth action around the continent on climate change, its mitigation and adaptation and sustainable development. In 2009, AYICC was granted observer
status to the African Minister Conference on Environment (AMCEN). AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a platform for
them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the Conference of Parties of UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others. AYICC
currently operates in over 45 African countries with over 20,000 members.

Founding Opportunities


AYICC Founding Opportunities

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the
environmental challenge of climate change will ultimately modify Africa's economies and livelihoods, health, social structure, infrastructure and natural
systems. To date little has been done to empower, capacitate and mobilise youth, particularly in Africa to address global environmental challenges such as
climate change. facebook d o w n ~ To remedy this, an initial step has been the formation of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC).

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change was formed partially in response to the poor representation of young Africans at the International Youth
Summit on Climate Change (November 24-28, 2005), which was held in conjunction with the United Nation's Climate Change Conference (November 28-
December 10, 2005) in Montreal , Canada. The overall mission of AYICC is to ensure that African youth are equipped toparticipate in future UNFCCC
meetings and other global initiatives for sustainable solutions to environmental degradation and climate change.

In order to ensure a strong youth presence in climate change dialogue and fora, there is a need for AYICC to ensure youth representation from various parts
of Africa. This will enable Africa's youth to engage with the global youth movement, governments and NGO's in a more coordinated and sustained manner.
The long term goal is to ensure sustainable and systematic global youth action, with special emphasis on African youth on the issue of climate change.

Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any financial assistance. The planning committee members have
volunteered their time and their contributions. However, in order to make this vision a reality we need to become a financially viable organisation. For this
reason, we would like to request your financial assistance in getting this vision off the ground.•

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE OPENING FORUM OF THE SEVENTH AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FORUM, 12TH OCTOBER

2010: Ms. Esther Agbarakwe, Nigeria




The Chair,

Climate Change poses significant challenges to future generations. As youth we have a stake in this future; it is our future.




                                                                                                                 O
As the 7th African Development Forum, we have indeed come of age, we are no longer in our childhood stages of determining sustainable development - the
time of maturity has arrived. This year is marked as the International Year of Youth and now, more than ever before, the youth are taking a stand. More than
anyone else, we, the Youth, face unprecedented challenges as a result of global climate change. We also share the responsibility of addressing ii. As a group,
we are key moral stakeholders in the international processes treating the most important challenge of our generation. As it is our future, we will be
disproportionately affected by the catastrophic impacts of climate change.

Advocacy and Behavior Change: II is critical for present and future leaders to collaborate on finding solutions. The need for cultural transformation in our time




                                                                              M
is stronger than ever. This transformation - that enables us to shift towards a more sustainable world - should be an organic process, guided by principles of
compassion, integrity and justice. We need to pragmatically rethink our behavioral patterns, to enable a paradigm shift that is based on an ongoing process of
action, reflection and meaningful participation. Awareness, education and empowerment are fundamental prerequisites to enabling this process, and the youth
are energetic and passionate about holding governments and all relevant stakeholders involved accountable for their actions. We are equal partners in this
process and commit ourselves fully to achieving the objectives as decided by this Forum.




                                                                            E
Contrary to what is believed; young people play a dynamic role in framing and implementing policies. So their role goes beyond advocacy. From an advocacy
perspective, young people are involved in songs and stories which spread awareness in local languages. Of course we understand the importance and
relevance of this because 70% of Africa is based in rural areas and the term Climate Change is foreign, Young people are finding ways of using words in local
languages to translate the message across.




                                                           D
It is time to shift the balance of decision-making towards the generation that will have to manage this unwanted inheritance, to make political and economic
decisions that can span a generation, and to enable real inter-generational and inter-cultural dialogue about climate change to be realized in institutions where
the youth generation can learn.

However at the same time a range of social learning and marketing approaches need to be developed to address the gap between classroom education styles
and education that stimulates real action. This gap prevents the cultural shift from token awareness to personal action and reaction.

Education: In relation to climate change, African Governments should begin at inception to mainstream youth voices and perceptions. This is particularly
important because climate change projections indicate that effects will begin to be most felt in the next 20-30 years - young people should begin to be part of
the solution so that they will be able to cope when disaster calls. Involving them in this programme will ensure that those who will be affected will have direct
knowledge of the challenges and strategies for coping as well as the ability to mobilize communities to respond to and prepare for the impact of climate change
and natural disasters.

Governments must give credence to the higher learning education system in Africa in particular the increased accent on improvement of research and
innovation on climate change specifically highlighting on policy and reform, the programmes, pedagogy and teaching tools. This will enhance an equipped pool
of intellectual capital among the young people on climate change issues who will replicate this to the various organizations and networks that they are part of.

Al government level, during the last Conference of the Parties (COP), ii was pleasing to see that many African delegations included youth and gave them a role
to play. Furthermore, many youth who were involved in COP 15 deliberations have been interacting with their various governments and engaging in processes
and procedures that are related to Climate change policy. There is an understanding that more needs to be done, and at this forum, I urge you to engage young
people who knock on your doors asking to be involved.

Youth and youth based NGOs play a major role either in strengthening local capacity to cope or by supporting local action. Already, groups such as the Nigerian
Youth Coalition and the African youth Climate Initiative-Kenya have established school climate clubs, which are creative ways to engage young people; these
initiatives should be mainstreamed into education systems. Young people in this governance process are important because successful adaptation requires a
host of innovative measures developed with vulnerable communities to improve their present and future livelihoods. Young people are vibrant and are able to
access places that many governmental institutions fail to access. As the majority of the population and Africa's future, it is important to include them in this
impending crisis that is Climate Change.

Already, this conference calls for integrated approaches to enable African countries to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change. There is a dire need
to have a clearer understanding of the potential calamities that climate change can bring and to start the discourse on how best to stave off the worst impacts.
There is already an understanding that

Climate Change is not a localized problem but transcends national borders, hence the need for co-operation of Intergovernmental agencies but also to include
those young and vulnerable people.

Conclusion :
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS059_1BillionAfrica","No longer can climate change be seen as merely an environmental problem or an energy challenge. It is a combination of both, which needs the involvement of
young people to preserve the environment and enter into green energy careers.

It's important for all of us to recognize that sustainable development isn't just a catch phrase - people all over the continent are taking it into their own hands. A
couple days ago over 300 community events took place in nearly every country on the continent of Africa, and more than 7000 globally as part of the Global
Work Party on 10/10/10.

Everywhere in the wortd, people planted trees, cultivated community gardens, installed solar panels, made buildings more efficient and implemented thousands
of other grassroots solutions to the climate crisis. We got to work everywhere in the world, but we need you, leaders, to get to work, too.

Thank you and God bless

                        African Youth at COP25

"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS059_1BillionAfrica","The 25th session of the Conference Parties (COP25) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held from the 2 -13
December bringing together nearly 27000 people to the Spanish capital. COP25
provided parties with the opportunity to finalize the ""rulebook"" of the Paris
Agreement - the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020.


In the spirit of the convention on climate change young people continue to enjoy




                                                                          O
various spaces during COP mainly through YOU NGO; the official youth
constituency to the UNFCCC. Article 6 ofthe Convention and Article 12 of the
Paris Agreement referred to as Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) encourage
the empowerment of every member of the society to take climate actions and
therefore young people who are most vulnerable to the climate crisis are




                                             M
increasingly becoming the centre of discussion.


The world today is home to the largest generation of young people in history and
their energy, creativity, and innovation, when harnessed properly, will accelerate




                                           E
sustainable solutions to the global crisis. Youth have a pivotal role to play in the
implementation of ACE which consists of six elements namely: education,
training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and
international cooperation.




                             D
At COP25, the Intergenerational Inquiry which is a highlight event of Young and
Future Generations Day and like every year provided a platform for youth and
decision-makers to discuss how young people can enhance the implementation
of the Paris Agreement. This platform was attended by the Executive Secretary of
the UNFCCC and provided an opportunity for young people to share the
outcome on the Conference of Youth (COY 15) to the secretariat.


The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) has continued to
empower and mobilize young people at COP through our side events and
exhibitions. Through an exhibition at COP 25, AYICC was able to showcase the
actions and contributions of African youth in the fight against climate change.
Such actions include ecological restorations, renewable energy promotion, and
local conference of youth hosted by our national chapters.


AYICC's greatest concern however, is with regards to the low representation of
African youth at the UNFCCC sessions. There are many contributing factors which
includes lack of funding, inability to assess accreditations and visas. As the first
step in addressing this, we will continue to encourage African countries to make
conscious efforts to include youth delegates in their official delegations for COPs.
We also call on development partners and stakeholders who are interested in
youth development to reach out with their support to AYICC to enhance African
youth participation in this important global process.

Climate Change


• Campaigns and Advocacy
 The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is widely known for our
 incessant campaigns and research-based advocacy on environmental and
 climate change topics. Since 2006 AYICC has been consistent with its
 campaigns impressing on African governments and international community
 alike to deliver on their commitment under the United Nations Framework
 Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) .



• Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)
 Climate change education, training, and awareness creation have been the
 central focus of AYICC targeting youth and vulnerable communities. We do
 this through workshops, conferences, and webinars leveraging on our robust
 online presence. Through our Flagship program; the African Youth Conference
 on Climate Change (AFRIYOCC) we are able to provide a platform for




                                                                     O
 exchange of ideas and sharing of knowledge and best practices among young
 African thereby feeding into article 6 of the climate change convention and
 article 12 of the Paris Agreement.



• Tree planting and Ecological restoration



                                         M
 Trees contribute to their environment by providing oxygen, improving air
 quality, climate amelioration, conserving water, preserving soil, and




                                       E
 supporting wildlife. Beyond the campaigns and advocacies, our member
 organizations embark on tree planting and reforestation activities including
 mangrove restoration along the coast.




                         D
• Renewable energy promotion
 With the increasing demand for energy for industrial and economic
 development, AYICC member organizations in different countries are
 promoting renewable energy access to isolated off-grid communities. AYICC
 believes that Youth-led renewable energy enterprises are a viable means of
 achieving sustainable development, as they promote technologies that are
 less harmful to the global environs while at the same time providing
 sustainable income-generating opportunities for youth .



• Youth in Agribusiness
 AYICC sees agriculture as an essential driver of economic development and an
 area of great opportunity for young people in Africa. The challenge, however,
 is that the growing youth population does not see agriculture as a profitable
 opportunity due to their lack of insight into the opportunities that exist within
 the agriculture value chain. Through our member organizations who are youth
 farmers themselves, AYICC has adopted various strategies including outreach
 to schools and communities, exhibitions and youth agricultural festivals as
 well as institution of award schemes for best youth farmers as a way to raise
 interest and awareness on the opportunities that exist within this sector.



• Recycling

                            products as a by-product of the increasing level of population, affluence, and
                            technological advancement in a given environment or society. In Africa we
                            have witnessed increasing level of pollution from plastic, car tires, bottles
                            among others and this has generated innovative thinking among young
                            people to provide a sustainable solution. Over the years, AYICC members have
                            redefined waste as a resource for sustainable development and through
                            various recycling initiatives, they are bringing life into materials that otherwise
                            could have been a nuisance to the environment.

The 1st African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) convened from 26th - 27th
October, 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, on the theme “African Youth Responses to Climate
Change and Food Security, Action from the Frontline.” The conference was organized by Africa
Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) in partnership with Africa Climate Policy Center
(ACPC), New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), Pan African Climate Justice
Alliance (PACJA) and Zimbabwe United Nations Association (ZUNA).
100 youths selected across Africa in the conference addressing the thematic strands of Youth in
Agribusiness; Climate Change and Development in Africa; Sustainable Agriculture and Food
Security; Green Economy and Technology Transfer; Climate Justice and Human Rights; and
Climate Change and Disaster risk reduction participated in this first edition of the African Youth
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC). This came at a time when Africa as a continent
continues to bear the biggest brunt of climate change due to low resilience and weak capacities,
with the youth despite their huge numbers and innovativeness among the vulnerable alongside
women. Despite the odds, they have been actively engaged in adaptation and mitigation




                                                                   O
initiatives that improve their communities’ resilience to climate change.
The conference therefore provided a platform for the African youths to interact and share best
practices. Five flagship projects were selected to be used as case studies by African Youths in
starting their own projects depending on transferability. The conference also saw the drafting of

African youth position for COP 21 which was handed over to African Group of Negotiators at the
fifth Climate Change and Development in Africa Conference (CCDA V).

(AfriYOCC-2016)

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the environmental challenge of climate
change is already modifying Africa’s economies and livelihoods, health, social structure,
infrastructure and natural systems. Over the years, African youth have proved their potential in
both promoting and implementing climate change adaptation projects in their communities.
Their innovations have continually been adopted in responding to climate change impacts. This
is despite various challenges that include low capacity and education, high rates of poverty and
lack of financial resources. At the same time, African youth have been minimally represented in
the respective country policy processes as well as during the UNFCCC climate change
negotiations. Above 50% of the African population are the youth. This justifies the urgent need
for youth capacity development to respond to climate change and inclusion as key stakeholders
in policy process and negotiations. AYICC aims to spearhead new innovations, look into new
systems of success to share with policy and decision-makers, and generally aim to improve on
the current system which is causing long-term and irreversible degradation to our livelihoods –
as the leading youth organization on climate change in Africa.



                                                                    O
In cognizance of the role and potential of the African youth in climate change mitigation and
adaptation and overall sustainable development trajectory, the second African Youth

Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC), shall be held in Nairobi, Kenya on 10th to 13th
October, 2016 as AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its formation in 2006 during the
second Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12. Building on the success of the first




                                               E
edition of conference, AfriYOCC shall provide an avenue for African youths to showcase their
climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, projects and initiatives. Best practices
arising from the various AYICC country chapters shall be developed to an African youth




                                    D
climate change adaptation and mitigation best practices database and handbook. The
meeting will dilate on the current post 2015 development agenda and the role of young
people in championing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in
Africa.

The delegates shall have an opportunity to visit ongoing Climate Change adaptation and
agribusiness projects in Kenya for hands-on skills and knowledge replicable in their countries.
Consequently, it shall boost the skills and capacities of African youths to substantially contribute
to the process leading towards and during COP 22. Through partnership with both
Governmental and Non-governmental agencies, the conference shall not only negotiate for
more youth representation in the respective country policy processes towards the forthcoming
CoPs and country specific policies, but also provide learning and engagement opportunities for
African youths. This will greatly enhance their current capacity and potential to actively
participate in both national and international platforms for policy formulation and implementation.
The conference will also provide a platform to re-assess the current position of our negotiators
and create awareness about the critical role young people should play in shifting agendas in the
forthcoming Conference of Parties in Marrakech come November 2016. While a 4 day gathering

issues affecting their livelihoods.

African youth have for long been side-lined to the periphery of the substantive civic and policy
issues facing the continent. However, the worst affected are the rural based youths and those
residing in farming communities, peri-urban areas and those from conflict and post conflict
countries. This has resulted in youths from these marginalized communities having no
knowledge and information on the basic climate change science and adaptation and mitigation
mechanisms. The good news though is that there is capacity amongst many young people who
are already in the circles of upcoming academia, policy specialists, lawyers, journalists and
scientists’ alike. These capacities need to be strengthened and skills shared amongst the wider
group of young people on the continent so that best practices are disseminated and resources
are expanded.

While it is an undeniable fact that climate change is affecting all regions globally, especially in
developing countries, the adverse effects in the future is likely to increase if the Paris agreement
is not ratified and effectuated by all parties. And even though a deal was achieved during
COP21 in Paris, the impacts of climate change will definitely continue into the future. This
suggests that young people will have to not just understand what climate change is and how it is




                                                                      O
affecting our world, opportunities that exists within, but most importantly, participate actively into
finding amicable solutions. Young people of Africa have therefore considered it an inherent
imperative to contribute to their future by organizing the 2nd African Youth Conference on
Climate Change in October 2016 under the theme, ‘Making Climate Finance work for




                                                  M
African Youth.’


2.1 CONFERENCE STRATEGY




                                                E
The conference program shall be based on exploring mechanisms to finance climate adaptation
and mitigation through Innovations in agriculture, technology and other sectors. It shall be




                                     D
highly interactive with unique workshop-style design that enables participants to develop their
potential through practical experience. Participants will divide to participate in thematic
workshops and come up with an African Youth position paper and concrete activities to be
included in the African Youth Strategy on Climate Change.

The delegates shall be engaged in pre-conference activities that shall include and not limited to,
mapping of youth climate change and/or mitigation projects within the conference key focus
areas for selection as best practice and include in the African youth climate change adaptation
and mitigation best practices database and handbook and aggressively fundraise towards their
participation and a successful workshop. The conference shall critically examine the various
country positions and the overall continents positions of the African Group of Negotiators, their
achievements and potentials towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It shall
examine the youth voices in these positions and further develop African youth position for
COP22.

We expect 200 youth leaders to participate in this conference. The conference is convened by
the AYICC continental secretariat in collaboration with AYICC Kenya chapter and the member

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is an umbrella youth network of African
based youth organizations, university groups, rural youth groups, schools, and individuals
working on climate change and sustainable development issues. It aims at developing capacity
and strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent need to take action
against the impacts of climate change for both present and future generations.

The initiative (always referred to as the movement) was conceived in Nairobi Kenya 10 years
ago, during the second Conference of Youth (COY2) preceding the 12th Conference of Parties
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC - COP12). The
main reason for its founding was to ensure the inclusion, and active participation of youths from
the south, and specifically Africa, in the international climate change negotiations. This was
needed as the youth are more than half the African population and are most affected by climate
change impacts. They also got massive potential to support the continent to take action on
global warming.

During its formation, it comprised of 8 country chapters and current has grown to 45 country
chapters with over 20,000 members across Africa and the Diaspora. This initiative has provided




                                                                  O
a platform for knowledge, ideas and experiences sharing. It is also an avenue for development
of skills and strategies on youth action on climate change mitigation and adaptation in the
African continent. AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a
platform for them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the




                                               M
UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others.

Since its inception, we have worked in partnership with international youth movements and have




                                             E
played a great role in the establishment of the International Youth Climate Movement whose
youth member organizations are now officially acknowledged by the UNFCCC as the YOUNGO
(Youth NGOs involved in the climate change negotiations process). Since COY2 in Nairobi, it




                                   D
has had youth delegates’ representation in all COP meetings.

In addition to the above, we have had landmark successes that include:
     A reach out programme for a children’s home (Watoto Wema in Ruai) and School
        climate change education program run in selected schools in Kenya.
     Leadership and mentorship programmes especially on volunteerism.
     Community development projects particularly on clean energy (energy saving stoves for
        rural folks)
     Capacity development of youth on agribusiness
     Advocacy campaigns e.g. lobbied for lanes to be set aside along the major highways for
        non-motorised transport especially for cyclists.
     Policy engagements i.e. contributing to the climate change bill 2012,as stakeholders
     Youth Caravan from Kenya to Durban during COP 17

Conference of Youth held just before the UNFCCC COP12. This initiative has continued to link, and share knowledge, ideas, experiences, skills and strategies
on youth action around the continent on climate change, its mitigation and adaptation and sustainable development. In 2009, AYICC was granted observer
status to the African Minister Conference on Environment (AMCEN). AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a platform for
them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the Conference of Parties of UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others. AYICC
currently operates in over 45 African countries with over 20,000 members.

In response, to the call by AU Heads of Sates and Government to establish the CAHOSCC Youth Programme on Climate Change (CYPCC),

Founding Opportunities


AYICC Founding Opportunities

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the
environmental challenge of climate change will ultimately modify Africa's economies and livelihoods, health, social structure, infrastructure and natural
systems. To date little has been done to empower, capacitate and mobilise youth, particularly in Africa to address global environmental challenges such as
climate change. facebook d o w n ~ To remedy this, an initial step has been the formation of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC).

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change was formed partially in response to the poor representation of young Africans at the International Youth
Summit on Climate Change (November 24-28, 2005), which was held in conjunction with the United Nation's Climate Change Conference (November 28-
December 10, 2005) in Montreal , Canada. The overall mission of AYICC is to ensure that African youth are equipped toparticipate in future UNFCCC
meetings and other global initiatives for sustainable solutions to environmental degradation and climate change.

In order to ensure a strong youth presence in climate change dialogue and fora, there is a need for AYICC to ensure youth representation from various parts
of Africa. This will enable Africa's youth to engage with the global youth movement, governments and NGO's in a more coordinated and sustained manner.
The long term goal is to ensure sustainable and systematic global youth action, with special emphasis on African youth on the issue of climate change.

Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any financial assistance. The planning committee members have
volunteered their time and their contributions. However, in order to make this vision a reality we need to become a financially viable organisation. For this
reason, we would like to request your financial assistance in getting this vision off the ground.•

                                                                                                                 O
As the 7th African Development Forum, we have indeed come of age, we are no longer in our childhood stages of determining sustainable development - the
time of maturity has arrived. This year is marked as the International Year of Youth and now, more than ever before, the youth are taking a stand. More than
anyone else, we, the Youth, face unprecedented challenges as a result of global climate change. We also share the responsibility of addressing ii. As a group,
we are key moral stakeholders in the international processes treating the most important challenge of our generation. As it is our future, we will be
disproportionately affected by the catastrophic impacts of climate change.

Advocacy and Behavior Change: II is critical for present and future leaders to collaborate on finding solutions. The need for cultural transformation in our time




                                                                              M
is stronger than ever. This transformation - that enables us to shift towards a more sustainable world - should be an organic process, guided by principles of
compassion, integrity and justice. We need to pragmatically rethink our behavioral patterns, to enable a paradigm shift that is based on an ongoing process of
action, reflection and meaningful participation. Awareness, education and empowerment are fundamental prerequisites to enabling this process, and the youth
are energetic and passionate about holding governments and all relevant stakeholders involved accountable for their actions. We are equal partners in this
process and commit ourselves fully to achieving the objectives as decided by this Forum.




                                                                            E
Contrary to what is believed; young people play a dynamic role in framing and implementing policies. So their role goes beyond advocacy. From an advocacy
perspective, young people are involved in songs and stories which spread awareness in local languages. Of course we understand the importance and
relevance of this because 70% of Africa is based in rural areas and the term Climate Change is foreign, Young people are finding ways of using words in local
languages to translate the message across.




                                                           D
It is time to shift the balance of decision-making towards the generation that will have to manage this unwanted inheritance, to make political and economic
decisions that can span a generation, and to enable real inter-generational and inter-cultural dialogue about climate change to be realized in institutions where
the youth generation can learn.

However at the same time a range of social learning and marketing approaches need to be developed to address the gap between classroom education styles
and education that stimulates real action. This gap prevents the cultural shift from token awareness to personal action and reaction.

Education: In relation to climate change, African Governments should begin at inception to mainstream youth voices and perceptions. This is particularly
important because climate change projections indicate that effects will begin to be most felt in the next 20-30 years - young people should begin to be part of
the solution so that they will be able to cope when disaster calls. Involving them in this programme will ensure that those who will be affected will have direct
knowledge of the challenges and strategies for coping as well as the ability to mobilize communities to respond to and prepare for the impact of climate change
and natural disasters.

Governments must give credence to the higher learning education system in Africa in particular the increased accent on improvement of research and
innovation on climate change specifically highlighting on policy and reform, the programmes, pedagogy and teaching tools. This will enhance an equipped pool
of intellectual capital among the young people on climate change issues who will replicate this to the various organizations and networks that they are part of.

Al government level, during the last Conference of the Parties (COP), ii was pleasing to see that many African delegations included youth and gave them a role
to play. Furthermore, many youth who were involved in COP 15 deliberations have been interacting with their various governments and engaging in processes
and procedures that are related to Climate change policy. There is an understanding that more needs to be done, and at this forum, I urge you to engage young
people who knock on your doors asking to be involved.

Youth and youth based NGOs play a major role either in strengthening local capacity to cope or by supporting local action. Already, groups such as the Nigerian
Youth Coalition and the African youth Climate Initiative-Kenya have established school climate clubs, which are creative ways to engage young people; these
initiatives should be mainstreamed into education systems. Young people in this governance process are important because successful adaptation requires a
host of innovative measures developed with vulnerable communities to improve their present and future livelihoods. Young people are vibrant and are able to
access places that many governmental institutions fail to access. As the majority of the population and Africa's future, it is important to include them in this
impending crisis that is Climate Change.

Already, this conference calls for integrated approaches to enable African countries to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change. There is a dire need
to have a clearer understanding of the potential calamities that climate change can bring and to start the discourse on how best to stave off the worst impacts.
There is already an understanding that

Climate Change is not a localized problem but transcends national borders, hence the need for co-operation of Intergovernmental agencies but also to include
those young and vulnerable people.

Conclusion :
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS092_OpenSocietyCivilSocietyLeadershipAwards_USA","No longer can climate change be seen as merely an environmental problem or an energy challenge. It is a combination of both, which needs the involvement of
young people to preserve the environment and enter into green energy careers.

It's important for all of us to recognize that sustainable development isn't just a catch phrase - people all over the continent are taking it into their own hands. A
couple days ago over 300 community events took place in nearly every country on the continent of Africa, and more than 7000 globally as part of the Global
Work Party on 10/10/10.

Everywhere in the wortd, people planted trees, cultivated community gardens, installed solar panels, made buildings more efficient and implemented thousands
of other grassroots solutions to the climate crisis. We got to work everywhere in the world, but we need you, leaders, to get to work, too.

Thank you and God bless

                        African Youth at COP25

                        by ayicc_admin · Published May 20, 2020 · Updated May 20, 2020
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS092_OpenSocietyCivilSocietyLeadershipAwards_USA","The 25th session of the Conference Parties (COP25) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held from the 2 -13
December bringing together nearly 27000 people to the Spanish capital. COP25
provided parties with the opportunity to finalize the ""rulebook"" of the Paris
Agreement - the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020.


In the spirit of the convention on climate change young people continue to enjoy




                                                                          O
various spaces during COP mainly through YOU NGO; the official youth
constituency to the UNFCCC. Article 6 ofthe Convention and Article 12 of the
Paris Agreement referred to as Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) encourage
the empowerment of every member of the society to take climate actions and
therefore young people who are most vulnerable to the climate crisis are




                                             M
increasingly becoming the centre of discussion.


The world today is home to the largest generation of young people in history and
their energy, creativity, and innovation, when harnessed properly, will accelerate




                                           E
sustainable solutions to the global crisis. Youth have a pivotal role to play in the
implementation of ACE which consists of six elements namely: education,
training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and
international cooperation.




                             D
At COP25, the Intergenerational Inquiry which is a highlight event of Young and
Future Generations Day and like every year provided a platform for youth and
decision-makers to discuss how young people can enhance the implementation
of the Paris Agreement. This platform was attended by the Executive Secretary of
the UNFCCC and provided an opportunity for young people to share the
outcome on the Conference of Youth (COY 15) to the secretariat.


The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) has continued to
empower and mobilize young people at COP through our side events and
exhibitions. Through an exhibition at COP 25, AYICC was able to showcase the
actions and contributions of African youth in the fight against climate change.
Such actions include ecological restorations, renewable energy promotion, and
local conference of youth hosted by our national chapters.


AYICC's greatest concern however, is with regards to the low representation of
African youth at the UNFCCC sessions. There are many contributing factors which
includes lack of funding, inability to assess accreditations and visas. As the first
step in addressing this, we will continue to encourage African countries to make
conscious efforts to include youth delegates in their official delegations for COPs.
We also call on development partners and stakeholders who are interested in
youth development to reach out with their support to AYICC to enhance African
youth participation in this important global process.

Climate Change


• Campaigns and Advocacy
 The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is widely known for our
 incessant campaigns and research-based advocacy on environmental and
 climate change topics. Since 2006 AYICC has been consistent with its
 campaigns impressing on African governments and international community
 alike to deliver on their commitment under the United Nations Framework
 Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) .



• Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)
 Climate change education, training, and awareness creation have been the
 central focus of AYICC targeting youth and vulnerable communities. We do
 this through workshops, conferences, and webinars leveraging on our robust
 online presence. Through our Flagship program; the African Youth Conference
 on Climate Change (AFRIYOCC) we are able to provide a platform for




                                                                     O
 exchange of ideas and sharing of knowledge and best practices among young
 African thereby feeding into article 6 of the climate change convention and
 article 12 of the Paris Agreement.



• Tree planting and Ecological restoration



                                         M
 Trees contribute to their environment by providing oxygen, improving air
 quality, climate amelioration, conserving water, preserving soil, and




                                       E
 supporting wildlife. Beyond the campaigns and advocacies, our member
 organizations embark on tree planting and reforestation activities including
 mangrove restoration along the coast.




                         D
• Renewable energy promotion
 With the increasing demand for energy for industrial and economic
 development, AYICC member organizations in different countries are
 promoting renewable energy access to isolated off-grid communities. AYICC
 believes that Youth-led renewable energy enterprises are a viable means of
 achieving sustainable development, as they promote technologies that are
 less harmful to the global environs while at the same time providing
 sustainable income-generating opportunities for youth .



• Youth in Agribusiness
 AYICC sees agriculture as an essential driver of economic development and an
 area of great opportunity for young people in Africa. The challenge, however,
 is that the growing youth population does not see agriculture as a profitable
 opportunity due to their lack of insight into the opportunities that exist within
 the agriculture value chain. Through our member organizations who are youth
 farmers themselves, AYICC has adopted various strategies including outreach
 to schools and communities, exhibitions and youth agricultural festivals as
 well as institution of award schemes for best youth farmers as a way to raise
 interest and awareness on the opportunities that exist within this sector.



• Recycling

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS092_OpenSocietyCivilSocietyLeadershipAwards_USA","                            Over recent years, the world has witnessed an increasing level of waste
                            products as a by-product of the increasing level of population, affluence, and
                            technological advancement in a given environment or society. In Africa we
                            have witnessed increasing level of pollution from plastic, car tires, bottles
                            among others and this has generated innovative thinking among young
                            people to provide a sustainable solution. Over the years, AYICC members have
                            redefined waste as a resource for sustainable development and through
                            various recycling initiatives, they are bringing life into materials that otherwise
                            could have been a nuisance to the environment.

The 1st African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) convened from 26th - 27th
October, 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, on the theme “African Youth Responses to Climate
Change and Food Security, Action from the Frontline.” The conference was organized by Africa
Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) in partnership with Africa Climate Policy Center
(ACPC), New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), Pan African Climate Justice
Alliance (PACJA) and Zimbabwe United Nations Association (ZUNA).
100 youths selected across Africa in the conference addressing the thematic strands of Youth in
Agribusiness; Climate Change and Development in Africa; Sustainable Agriculture and Food
Security; Green Economy and Technology Transfer; Climate Justice and Human Rights; and
Climate Change and Disaster risk reduction participated in this first edition of the African Youth
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC). This came at a time when Africa as a continent
continues to bear the biggest brunt of climate change due to low resilience and weak capacities,
with the youth despite their huge numbers and innovativeness among the vulnerable alongside
women. Despite the odds, they have been actively engaged in adaptation and mitigation




                                                                   O
initiatives that improve their communities’ resilience to climate change.
The conference therefore provided a platform for the African youths to interact and share best
practices. Five flagship projects were selected to be used as case studies by African Youths in
starting their own projects depending on transferability. The conference also saw the drafting of

(AfriYOCC-2016)

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the environmental challenge of climate
change is already modifying Africa’s economies and livelihoods, health, social structure,
infrastructure and natural systems. Over the years, African youth have proved their potential in
both promoting and implementing climate change adaptation projects in their communities.
Their innovations have continually been adopted in responding to climate change impacts. This
is despite various challenges that include low capacity and education, high rates of poverty and
lack of financial resources. At the same time, African youth have been minimally represented in
the respective country policy processes as well as during the UNFCCC climate change
negotiations. Above 50% of the African population are the youth. This justifies the urgent need
for youth capacity development to respond to climate change and inclusion as key stakeholders
in policy process and negotiations. AYICC aims to spearhead new innovations, look into new
systems of success to share with policy and decision-makers, and generally aim to improve on
the current system which is causing long-term and irreversible degradation to our livelihoods –
as the leading youth organization on climate change in Africa.



                                                                    O
In cognizance of the role and potential of the African youth in climate change mitigation and
adaptation and overall sustainable development trajectory, the second African Youth

October, 2016 as AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its formation in 2006 during the
second Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12. Building on the success of the first

edition of conference, AfriYOCC shall provide an avenue for African youths to showcase their
climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, projects and initiatives. Best practices
arising from the various AYICC country chapters shall be developed to an African youth

meeting will dilate on the current post 2015 development agenda and the role of young
people in championing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in
Africa.

The delegates shall have an opportunity to visit ongoing Climate Change adaptation and
agribusiness projects in Kenya for hands-on skills and knowledge replicable in their countries.
Consequently, it shall boost the skills and capacities of African youths to substantially contribute
to the process leading towards and during COP 22. Through partnership with both
Governmental and Non-governmental agencies, the conference shall not only negotiate for
more youth representation in the respective country policy processes towards the forthcoming
CoPs and country specific policies, but also provide learning and engagement opportunities for
African youths. This will greatly enhance their current capacity and potential to actively
participate in both national and international platforms for policy formulation and implementation.
The conference will also provide a platform to re-assess the current position of our negotiators
and create awareness about the critical role young people should play in shifting agendas in the
forthcoming Conference of Parties in Marrakech come November 2016. While a 4 day gathering

issues affecting their livelihoods.

African youth have for long been side-lined to the periphery of the substantive civic and policy
issues facing the continent. However, the worst affected are the rural based youths and those
residing in farming communities, peri-urban areas and those from conflict and post conflict
countries. This has resulted in youths from these marginalized communities having no
knowledge and information on the basic climate change science and adaptation and mitigation
mechanisms. The good news though is that there is capacity amongst many young people who
are already in the circles of upcoming academia, policy specialists, lawyers, journalists and
scientists’ alike. These capacities need to be strengthened and skills shared amongst the wider
group of young people on the continent so that best practices are disseminated and resources
are expanded.

While it is an undeniable fact that climate change is affecting all regions globally, especially in
developing countries, the adverse effects in the future is likely to increase if the Paris agreement
is not ratified and effectuated by all parties. And even though a deal was achieved during
COP21 in Paris, the impacts of climate change will definitely continue into the future. This
suggests that young people will have to not just understand what climate change is and how it is




                                                                      O
affecting our world, opportunities that exists within, but most importantly, participate actively into
finding amicable solutions. Young people of Africa have therefore considered it an inherent
imperative to contribute to their future by organizing the 2nd African Youth Conference on
Climate Change in October 2016 under the theme, ‘Making Climate Finance work for




                                                  M
African Youth.’


2.1 CONFERENCE STRATEGY




                                                E
The conference program shall be based on exploring mechanisms to finance climate adaptation
and mitigation through Innovations in agriculture, technology and other sectors. It shall be




                                     D
highly interactive with unique workshop-style design that enables participants to develop their
potential through practical experience. Participants will divide to participate in thematic
workshops and come up with an African Youth position paper and concrete activities to be
included in the African Youth Strategy on Climate Change.

The delegates shall be engaged in pre-conference activities that shall include and not limited to,
mapping of youth climate change and/or mitigation projects within the conference key focus
areas for selection as best practice and include in the African youth climate change adaptation
and mitigation best practices database and handbook and aggressively fundraise towards their
participation and a successful workshop. The conference shall critically examine the various
country positions and the overall continents positions of the African Group of Negotiators, their
achievements and potentials towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It shall
examine the youth voices in these positions and further develop African youth position for

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is an umbrella youth network of African
based youth organizations, university groups, rural youth groups, schools, and individuals
working on climate change and sustainable development issues. It aims at developing capacity
and strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent need to take action
against the impacts of climate change for both present and future generations.

The initiative (always referred to as the movement) was conceived in Nairobi Kenya 10 years
ago, during the second Conference of Youth (COY2) preceding the 12th Conference of Parties
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC - COP12). The
main reason for its founding was to ensure the inclusion, and active participation of youths from
the south, and specifically Africa, in the international climate change negotiations. This was
needed as the youth are more than half the African population and are most affected by climate
change impacts. They also got massive potential to support the continent to take action on
global warming.

During its formation, it comprised of 8 country chapters and current has grown to 45 country
chapters with over 20,000 members across Africa and the Diaspora. This initiative has provided




                                                                  O
a platform for knowledge, ideas and experiences sharing. It is also an avenue for development
of skills and strategies on youth action on climate change mitigation and adaptation in the
African continent. AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a
platform for them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the




                                               M
UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others.

Since its inception, we have worked in partnership with international youth movements and have




                                             E
played a great role in the establishment of the International Youth Climate Movement whose
youth member organizations are now officially acknowledged by the UNFCCC as the YOUNGO
(Youth NGOs involved in the climate change negotiations process). Since COY2 in Nairobi, it




                                   D
has had youth delegates’ representation in all COP meetings.

In addition to the above, we have had landmark successes that include:
     A reach out programme for a children’s home (Watoto Wema in Ruai) and School
        climate change education program run in selected schools in Kenya.
     Leadership and mentorship programmes especially on volunteerism.
     Community development projects particularly on clean energy (energy saving stoves for
        rural folks)
     Capacity development of youth on agribusiness
     Advocacy campaigns e.g. lobbied for lanes to be set aside along the major highways for
        non-motorised transport especially for cyclists.
     Policy engagements i.e. contributing to the climate change bill 2012,as stakeholders
     Youth Caravan from Kenya to Durban during COP 17

Our charter (Charter of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change) can be found on
www.ayicc.net.
Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any
financial assistance, the greatest resource being the time and skills that the leadership
committee and members contribute. However, in order to scale up our actions and make AYICC
vision a reality, there is need for more human and financial resources.

Founding Opportunities


AYICC Founding Opportunities

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the
environmental challenge of climate change will ultimately modify Africa's economies and livelihoods, health, social structure, infrastructure and natural
systems. To date little has been done to empower, capacitate and mobilise youth, particularly in Africa to address global environmental challenges such as
climate change. facebook d o w n ~ To remedy this, an initial step has been the formation of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC).

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change was formed partially in response to the poor representation of young Africans at the International Youth
Summit on Climate Change (November 24-28, 2005), which was held in conjunction with the United Nation's Climate Change Conference (November 28-
December 10, 2005) in Montreal , Canada. The overall mission of AYICC is to ensure that African youth are equipped toparticipate in future UNFCCC
meetings and other global initiatives for sustainable solutions to environmental degradation and climate change.

In order to ensure a strong youth presence in climate change dialogue and fora, there is a need for AYICC to ensure youth representation from various parts
of Africa. This will enable Africa's youth to engage with the global youth movement, governments and NGO's in a more coordinated and sustained manner.
The long term goal is to ensure sustainable and systematic global youth action, with special emphasis on African youth on the issue of climate change.

Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any financial assistance. The planning committee members have
volunteered their time and their contributions. However, in order to make this vision a reality we need to become a financially viable organisation. For this
reason, we would like to request your financial assistance in getting this vision off the ground.•

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE OPENING FORUM OF THE SEVENTH AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FORUM, 12TH OCTOBER

2010: Ms. Esther Agbarakwe, Nigeria




The Chair,

Climate Change poses significant challenges to future generations. As youth we have a stake in this future; it is our future.




                                                                                                                 O
As the 7th African Development Forum, we have indeed come of age, we are no longer in our childhood stages of determining sustainable development - the
time of maturity has arrived. This year is marked as the International Year of Youth and now, more than ever before, the youth are taking a stand. More than
anyone else, we, the Youth, face unprecedented challenges as a result of global climate change. We also share the responsibility of addressing ii. As a group,
we are key moral stakeholders in the international processes treating the most important challenge of our generation. As it is our future, we will be
disproportionately affected by the catastrophic impacts of climate change.

Advocacy and Behavior Change: II is critical for present and future leaders to collaborate on finding solutions. The need for cultural transformation in our time




                                                                              M
is stronger than ever. This transformation - that enables us to shift towards a more sustainable world - should be an organic process, guided by principles of
compassion, integrity and justice. We need to pragmatically rethink our behavioral patterns, to enable a paradigm shift that is based on an ongoing process of
action, reflection and meaningful participation. Awareness, education and empowerment are fundamental prerequisites to enabling this process, and the youth
are energetic and passionate about holding governments and all relevant stakeholders involved accountable for their actions. We are equal partners in this
process and commit ourselves fully to achieving the objectives as decided by this Forum.




                                                                            E
Contrary to what is believed; young people play a dynamic role in framing and implementing policies. So their role goes beyond advocacy. From an advocacy
perspective, young people are involved in songs and stories which spread awareness in local languages. Of course we understand the importance and
relevance of this because 70% of Africa is based in rural areas and the term Climate Change is foreign, Young people are finding ways of using words in local
languages to translate the message across.




                                                           D
It is time to shift the balance of decision-making towards the generation that will have to manage this unwanted inheritance, to make political and economic
decisions that can span a generation, and to enable real inter-generational and inter-cultural dialogue about climate change to be realized in institutions where
the youth generation can learn.

However at the same time a range of social learning and marketing approaches need to be developed to address the gap between classroom education styles
and education that stimulates real action. This gap prevents the cultural shift from token awareness to personal action and reaction.

Education: In relation to climate change, African Governments should begin at inception to mainstream youth voices and perceptions. This is particularly
important because climate change projections indicate that effects will begin to be most felt in the next 20-30 years - young people should begin to be part of
the solution so that they will be able to cope when disaster calls. Involving them in this programme will ensure that those who will be affected will have direct
knowledge of the challenges and strategies for coping as well as the ability to mobilize communities to respond to and prepare for the impact of climate change
and natural disasters.

Governments must give credence to the higher learning education system in Africa in particular the increased accent on improvement of research and
innovation on climate change specifically highlighting on policy and reform, the programmes, pedagogy and teaching tools. This will enhance an equipped pool
of intellectual capital among the young people on climate change issues who will replicate this to the various organizations and networks that they are part of.

Al government level, during the last Conference of the Parties (COP), ii was pleasing to see that many African delegations included youth and gave them a role
to play. Furthermore, many youth who were involved in COP 15 deliberations have been interacting with their various governments and engaging in processes
and procedures that are related to Climate change policy. There is an understanding that more needs to be done, and at this forum, I urge you to engage young
people who knock on your doors asking to be involved.

Youth and youth based NGOs play a major role either in strengthening local capacity to cope or by supporting local action. Already, groups such as the Nigerian
Youth Coalition and the African youth Climate Initiative-Kenya have established school climate clubs, which are creative ways to engage young people; these
initiatives should be mainstreamed into education systems. Young people in this governance process are important because successful adaptation requires a
host of innovative measures developed with vulnerable communities to improve their present and future livelihoods. Young people are vibrant and are able to
access places that many governmental institutions fail to access. As the majority of the population and Africa's future, it is important to include them in this
impending crisis that is Climate Change.

Already, this conference calls for integrated approaches to enable African countries to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change. There is a dire need
to have a clearer understanding of the potential calamities that climate change can bring and to start the discourse on how best to stave off the worst impacts.
There is already an understanding that

Climate Change is not a localized problem but transcends national borders, hence the need for co-operation of Intergovernmental agencies but also to include
those young and vulnerable people.

Conclusion :
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS093_CommonwealthScholarship","No longer can climate change be seen as merely an environmental problem or an energy challenge. It is a combination of both, which needs the involvement of
young people to preserve the environment and enter into green energy careers.

It's important for all of us to recognize that sustainable development isn't just a catch phrase - people all over the continent are taking it into their own hands. A
couple days ago over 300 community events took place in nearly every country on the continent of Africa, and more than 7000 globally as part of the Global
Work Party on 10/10/10.

Everywhere in the wortd, people planted trees, cultivated community gardens, installed solar panels, made buildings more efficient and implemented thousands
of other grassroots solutions to the climate crisis. We got to work everywhere in the world, but we need you, leaders, to get to work, too.

Thank you and God bless

                        African Youth at COP25

                        by ayicc_admin · Published May 20, 2020 · Updated May 20, 2020
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS093_CommonwealthScholarship","The 25th session of the Conference Parties (COP25) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held from the 2 -13
December bringing together nearly 27000 people to the Spanish capital. COP25
provided parties with the opportunity to finalize the ""rulebook"" of the Paris
Agreement - the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020.


In the spirit of the convention on climate change young people continue to enjoy




                                                                          O
various spaces during COP mainly through YOU NGO; the official youth
constituency to the UNFCCC. Article 6 ofthe Convention and Article 12 of the
Paris Agreement referred to as Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) encourage
the empowerment of every member of the society to take climate actions and
therefore young people who are most vulnerable to the climate crisis are




                                             M
increasingly becoming the centre of discussion.


The world today is home to the largest generation of young people in history and
their energy, creativity, and innovation, when harnessed properly, will accelerate




                                           E
sustainable solutions to the global crisis. Youth have a pivotal role to play in the
implementation of ACE which consists of six elements namely: education,
training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and
international cooperation.




                             D
At COP25, the Intergenerational Inquiry which is a highlight event of Young and
Future Generations Day and like every year provided a platform for youth and
decision-makers to discuss how young people can enhance the implementation
of the Paris Agreement. This platform was attended by the Executive Secretary of
the UNFCCC and provided an opportunity for young people to share the
outcome on the Conference of Youth (COY 15) to the secretariat.


The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) has continued to
empower and mobilize young people at COP through our side events and
exhibitions. Through an exhibition at COP 25, AYICC was able to showcase the
actions and contributions of African youth in the fight against climate change.
Such actions include ecological restorations, renewable energy promotion, and
local conference of youth hosted by our national chapters.


AYICC's greatest concern however, is with regards to the low representation of
African youth at the UNFCCC sessions. There are many contributing factors which
includes lack of funding, inability to assess accreditations and visas. As the first
step in addressing this, we will continue to encourage African countries to make
conscious efforts to include youth delegates in their official delegations for COPs.
We also call on development partners and stakeholders who are interested in
youth development to reach out with their support to AYICC to enhance African
youth participation in this important global process.

Climate Change


• Campaigns and Advocacy
 The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is widely known for our
 incessant campaigns and research-based advocacy on environmental and
 climate change topics. Since 2006 AYICC has been consistent with its
 campaigns impressing on African governments and international community
 alike to deliver on their commitment under the United Nations Framework
 Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) .



• Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)
 Climate change education, training, and awareness creation have been the
 central focus of AYICC targeting youth and vulnerable communities. We do
 this through workshops, conferences, and webinars leveraging on our robust
 online presence. Through our Flagship program; the African Youth Conference
 on Climate Change (AFRIYOCC) we are able to provide a platform for




                                                                     O
 exchange of ideas and sharing of knowledge and best practices among young
 African thereby feeding into article 6 of the climate change convention and
 article 12 of the Paris Agreement.



• Tree planting and Ecological restoration



                                         M
 Trees contribute to their environment by providing oxygen, improving air
 quality, climate amelioration, conserving water, preserving soil, and




                                       E
 supporting wildlife. Beyond the campaigns and advocacies, our member
 organizations embark on tree planting and reforestation activities including
 mangrove restoration along the coast.




                         D
• Renewable energy promotion
 With the increasing demand for energy for industrial and economic
 development, AYICC member organizations in different countries are
 promoting renewable energy access to isolated off-grid communities. AYICC
 believes that Youth-led renewable energy enterprises are a viable means of
 achieving sustainable development, as they promote technologies that are
 less harmful to the global environs while at the same time providing
 sustainable income-generating opportunities for youth .



• Youth in Agribusiness
 AYICC sees agriculture as an essential driver of economic development and an
 area of great opportunity for young people in Africa. The challenge, however,
 is that the growing youth population does not see agriculture as a profitable
 opportunity due to their lack of insight into the opportunities that exist within
 the agriculture value chain. Through our member organizations who are youth
 farmers themselves, AYICC has adopted various strategies including outreach
 to schools and communities, exhibitions and youth agricultural festivals as
 well as institution of award schemes for best youth farmers as a way to raise
 interest and awareness on the opportunities that exist within this sector.



• Recycling

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS093_CommonwealthScholarship","                            Over recent years, the world has witnessed an increasing level of waste
                            products as a by-product of the increasing level of population, affluence, and
                            technological advancement in a given environment or society. In Africa we
                            have witnessed increasing level of pollution from plastic, car tires, bottles
                            among others and this has generated innovative thinking among young
                            people to provide a sustainable solution. Over the years, AYICC members have
                            redefined waste as a resource for sustainable development and through
                            various recycling initiatives, they are bringing life into materials that otherwise
                            could have been a nuisance to the environment.

The 1st African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) convened from 26th - 27th
October, 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, on the theme “African Youth Responses to Climate
Change and Food Security, Action from the Frontline.” The conference was organized by Africa
Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) in partnership with Africa Climate Policy Center
(ACPC), New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), Pan African Climate Justice
Alliance (PACJA) and Zimbabwe United Nations Association (ZUNA).
100 youths selected across Africa in the conference addressing the thematic strands of Youth in
Agribusiness; Climate Change and Development in Africa; Sustainable Agriculture and Food
Security; Green Economy and Technology Transfer; Climate Justice and Human Rights; and
Climate Change and Disaster risk reduction participated in this first edition of the African Youth
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC). This came at a time when Africa as a continent
continues to bear the biggest brunt of climate change due to low resilience and weak capacities,
with the youth despite their huge numbers and innovativeness among the vulnerable alongside
women. Despite the odds, they have been actively engaged in adaptation and mitigation




                                                                   O
initiatives that improve their communities’ resilience to climate change.
The conference therefore provided a platform for the African youths to interact and share best
practices. Five flagship projects were selected to be used as case studies by African Youths in
starting their own projects depending on transferability. The conference also saw the drafting of

(AfriYOCC-2016)

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the environmental challenge of climate
change is already modifying Africa’s economies and livelihoods, health, social structure,
infrastructure and natural systems. Over the years, African youth have proved their potential in
both promoting and implementing climate change adaptation projects in their communities.
Their innovations have continually been adopted in responding to climate change impacts. This
is despite various challenges that include low capacity and education, high rates of poverty and
lack of financial resources. At the same time, African youth have been minimally represented in
the respective country policy processes as well as during the UNFCCC climate change
negotiations. Above 50% of the African population are the youth. This justifies the urgent need
for youth capacity development to respond to climate change and inclusion as key stakeholders
in policy process and negotiations. AYICC aims to spearhead new innovations, look into new
systems of success to share with policy and decision-makers, and generally aim to improve on
the current system which is causing long-term and irreversible degradation to our livelihoods –
as the leading youth organization on climate change in Africa.



                                                                    O
In cognizance of the role and potential of the African youth in climate change mitigation and
adaptation and overall sustainable development trajectory, the second African Youth

October, 2016 as AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its formation in 2006 during the
second Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12. Building on the success of the first

edition of conference, AfriYOCC shall provide an avenue for African youths to showcase their
climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, projects and initiatives. Best practices
arising from the various AYICC country chapters shall be developed to an African youth

climate change adaptation and mitigation best practices database and handbook. The
meeting will dilate on the current post 2015 development agenda and the role of young
people in championing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in
Africa.

The delegates shall have an opportunity to visit ongoing Climate Change adaptation and
agribusiness projects in Kenya for hands-on skills and knowledge replicable in their countries.
Consequently, it shall boost the skills and capacities of African youths to substantially contribute
to the process leading towards and during COP 22. Through partnership with both
Governmental and Non-governmental agencies, the conference shall not only negotiate for
more youth representation in the respective country policy processes towards the forthcoming
CoPs and country specific policies, but also provide learning and engagement opportunities for
African youths. This will greatly enhance their current capacity and potential to actively
participate in both national and international platforms for policy formulation and implementation.
The conference will also provide a platform to re-assess the current position of our negotiators
and create awareness about the critical role young people should play in shifting agendas in the
forthcoming Conference of Parties in Marrakech come November 2016. While a 4 day gathering

issues affecting their livelihoods.

African youth have for long been side-lined to the periphery of the substantive civic and policy
issues facing the continent. However, the worst affected are the rural based youths and those
residing in farming communities, peri-urban areas and those from conflict and post conflict
countries. This has resulted in youths from these marginalized communities having no
knowledge and information on the basic climate change science and adaptation and mitigation
mechanisms. The good news though is that there is capacity amongst many young people who
are already in the circles of upcoming academia, policy specialists, lawyers, journalists and
scientists’ alike. These capacities need to be strengthened and skills shared amongst the wider
group of young people on the continent so that best practices are disseminated and resources
are expanded.

While it is an undeniable fact that climate change is affecting all regions globally, especially in
developing countries, the adverse effects in the future is likely to increase if the Paris agreement
is not ratified and effectuated by all parties. And even though a deal was achieved during
COP21 in Paris, the impacts of climate change will definitely continue into the future. This
suggests that young people will have to not just understand what climate change is and how it is




                                                                      O
affecting our world, opportunities that exists within, but most importantly, participate actively into
finding amicable solutions. Young people of Africa have therefore considered it an inherent
imperative to contribute to their future by organizing the 2nd African Youth Conference on
Climate Change in October 2016 under the theme, ‘Making Climate Finance work for




                                                  M
African Youth.’

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is an umbrella youth network of African
based youth organizations, university groups, rural youth groups, schools, and individuals
working on climate change and sustainable development issues. It aims at developing capacity
and strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent need to take action
against the impacts of climate change for both present and future generations.

The initiative (always referred to as the movement) was conceived in Nairobi Kenya 10 years
ago, during the second Conference of Youth (COY2) preceding the 12th Conference of Parties
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC - COP12). The
main reason for its founding was to ensure the inclusion, and active participation of youths from
the south, and specifically Africa, in the international climate change negotiations. This was
needed as the youth are more than half the African population and are most affected by climate
change impacts. They also got massive potential to support the continent to take action on
global warming.

During its formation, it comprised of 8 country chapters and current has grown to 45 country
chapters with over 20,000 members across Africa and the Diaspora. This initiative has provided




                                                                  O
a platform for knowledge, ideas and experiences sharing. It is also an avenue for development
of skills and strategies on youth action on climate change mitigation and adaptation in the
African continent. AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a
platform for them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the




                                               M
UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others.

Since its inception, we have worked in partnership with international youth movements and have




                                             E
played a great role in the establishment of the International Youth Climate Movement whose
youth member organizations are now officially acknowledged by the UNFCCC as the YOUNGO
(Youth NGOs involved in the climate change negotiations process). Since COY2 in Nairobi, it




                                   D
has had youth delegates’ representation in all COP meetings.

In addition to the above, we have had landmark successes that include:
     A reach out programme for a children’s home (Watoto Wema in Ruai) and School
        climate change education program run in selected schools in Kenya.
     Leadership and mentorship programmes especially on volunteerism.
     Community development projects particularly on clean energy (energy saving stoves for
        rural folks)
     Capacity development of youth on agribusiness
     Advocacy campaigns e.g. lobbied for lanes to be set aside along the major highways for
        non-motorised transport especially for cyclists.
     Policy engagements i.e. contributing to the climate change bill 2012,as stakeholders
     Youth Caravan from Kenya to Durban during COP 17

Our charter (Charter of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change) can be found on
www.ayicc.net.
Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any
financial assistance, the greatest resource being the time and skills that the leadership
committee and members contribute. However, in order to scale up our actions and make AYICC
vision a reality, there is need for more human and financial resources.

African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) 2016

African Youth Conference on Climate Change will take place in Nairobi in Kenya. The conference is organized by the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change
(AYICC) and the African Climate Policy Centre from the 10 to 13 October 2016. AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its fonmation in 2006 during the second
Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12.

African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) www.ayicc.net is a continental youth network that was conceived in 2006 in Nairobi Kenya, during the
Conference of Youth held just before the UNFCCC COP12. This initiative has continued to link, and share knowledge, ideas, experiences, skills and strategies
on youth action around the continent on climate change, its mitigation and adaptation and sustainable development. In 2009, AYICC was granted observer
status to the African Minister Conference on Environment (AMCEN). AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a platform for
them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the Conference of Parties of UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others. AYICC
currently operates in over 45 African countries with over 20,000 members.

In response, to the call by AU Heads of Sates and Government to establish the CAHOSCC Youth Programme on Climate Change (CYPCC),
(Assembly/AU/Dec.538{XXIII}) and cognizant of the key role played by African youths in climate change mitigation and adaptation and overall sustainable
development. AYICC is convening the Second African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) from the 10 to 13 October 2016, after the successful
hosting of the first edition held from 26th to 27th October 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimababwe.       ~


AfriYOCC 2016, shall provide an avenue for African youths to showcase their climate change adaptation
and mitigation strategies, projects and initiatives. Best practices arising from the various AYICC country
chapters shall be showcased and the African youth climate change adaptation and mitigation best

Founding Opportunities


AYICC Founding Opportunities

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the
environmental challenge of climate change will ultimately modify Africa's economies and livelihoods, health, social structure, infrastructure and natural
systems. To date little has been done to empower, capacitate and mobilise youth, particularly in Africa to address global environmental challenges such as
climate change. facebook d o w n ~ To remedy this, an initial step has been the formation of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC).

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change was formed partially in response to the poor representation of young Africans at the International Youth
Summit on Climate Change (November 24-28, 2005), which was held in conjunction with the United Nation's Climate Change Conference (November 28-
December 10, 2005) in Montreal , Canada. The overall mission of AYICC is to ensure that African youth are equipped toparticipate in future UNFCCC
meetings and other global initiatives for sustainable solutions to environmental degradation and climate change.

In order to ensure a strong youth presence in climate change dialogue and fora, there is a need for AYICC to ensure youth representation from various parts
of Africa. This will enable Africa's youth to engage with the global youth movement, governments and NGO's in a more coordinated and sustained manner.
The long term goal is to ensure sustainable and systematic global youth action, with special emphasis on African youth on the issue of climate change.

Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any financial assistance. The planning committee members have
volunteered their time and their contributions. However, in order to make this vision a reality we need to become a financially viable organisation. For this
reason, we would like to request your financial assistance in getting this vision off the ground.•

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE OPENING FORUM OF THE SEVENTH AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FORUM, 12TH OCTOBER

2010: Ms. Esther Agbarakwe, Nigeria




The Chair,

Climate Change poses significant challenges to future generations. As youth we have a stake in this future; it is our future.




                                                                                                                 O
As the 7th African Development Forum, we have indeed come of age, we are no longer in our childhood stages of determining sustainable development - the
time of maturity has arrived. This year is marked as the International Year of Youth and now, more than ever before, the youth are taking a stand. More than
anyone else, we, the Youth, face unprecedented challenges as a result of global climate change. We also share the responsibility of addressing ii. As a group,
we are key moral stakeholders in the international processes treating the most important challenge of our generation. As it is our future, we will be
disproportionately affected by the catastrophic impacts of climate change.

Advocacy and Behavior Change: II is critical for present and future leaders to collaborate on finding solutions. The need for cultural transformation in our time




                                                                              M
is stronger than ever. This transformation - that enables us to shift towards a more sustainable world - should be an organic process, guided by principles of
compassion, integrity and justice. We need to pragmatically rethink our behavioral patterns, to enable a paradigm shift that is based on an ongoing process of
action, reflection and meaningful participation. Awareness, education and empowerment are fundamental prerequisites to enabling this process, and the youth
are energetic and passionate about holding governments and all relevant stakeholders involved accountable for their actions. We are equal partners in this
process and commit ourselves fully to achieving the objectives as decided by this Forum.




                                                                            E
Contrary to what is believed; young people play a dynamic role in framing and implementing policies. So their role goes beyond advocacy. From an advocacy
perspective, young people are involved in songs and stories which spread awareness in local languages. Of course we understand the importance and
relevance of this because 70% of Africa is based in rural areas and the term Climate Change is foreign, Young people are finding ways of using words in local
languages to translate the message across.




                                                           D
It is time to shift the balance of decision-making towards the generation that will have to manage this unwanted inheritance, to make political and economic
decisions that can span a generation, and to enable real inter-generational and inter-cultural dialogue about climate change to be realized in institutions where
the youth generation can learn.

However at the same time a range of social learning and marketing approaches need to be developed to address the gap between classroom education styles
and education that stimulates real action. This gap prevents the cultural shift from token awareness to personal action and reaction.

Education: In relation to climate change, African Governments should begin at inception to mainstream youth voices and perceptions. This is particularly
important because climate change projections indicate that effects will begin to be most felt in the next 20-30 years - young people should begin to be part of
the solution so that they will be able to cope when disaster calls. Involving them in this programme will ensure that those who will be affected will have direct
knowledge of the challenges and strategies for coping as well as the ability to mobilize communities to respond to and prepare for the impact of climate change
and natural disasters.

Governments must give credence to the higher learning education system in Africa in particular the increased accent on improvement of research and
innovation on climate change specifically highlighting on policy and reform, the programmes, pedagogy and teaching tools. This will enhance an equipped pool
of intellectual capital among the young people on climate change issues who will replicate this to the various organizations and networks that they are part of.

Al government level, during the last Conference of the Parties (COP), ii was pleasing to see that many African delegations included youth and gave them a role
to play. Furthermore, many youth who were involved in COP 15 deliberations have been interacting with their various governments and engaging in processes
and procedures that are related to Climate change policy. There is an understanding that more needs to be done, and at this forum, I urge you to engage young
people who knock on your doors asking to be involved.

Youth and youth based NGOs play a major role either in strengthening local capacity to cope or by supporting local action. Already, groups such as the Nigerian
Youth Coalition and the African youth Climate Initiative-Kenya have established school climate clubs, which are creative ways to engage young people; these
initiatives should be mainstreamed into education systems. Young people in this governance process are important because successful adaptation requires a
host of innovative measures developed with vulnerable communities to improve their present and future livelihoods. Young people are vibrant and are able to
access places that many governmental institutions fail to access. As the majority of the population and Africa's future, it is important to include them in this
impending crisis that is Climate Change.

Already, this conference calls for integrated approaches to enable African countries to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change. There is a dire need
to have a clearer understanding of the potential calamities that climate change can bring and to start the discourse on how best to stave off the worst impacts.
There is already an understanding that

Climate Change is not a localized problem but transcends national borders, hence the need for co-operation of Intergovernmental agencies but also to include
those young and vulnerable people.

Conclusion :
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS136_KectilGeneration","No longer can climate change be seen as merely an environmental problem or an energy challenge. It is a combination of both, which needs the involvement of
young people to preserve the environment and enter into green energy careers.

It's important for all of us to recognize that sustainable development isn't just a catch phrase - people all over the continent are taking it into their own hands. A
couple days ago over 300 community events took place in nearly every country on the continent of Africa, and more than 7000 globally as part of the Global
Work Party on 10/10/10.

Everywhere in the wortd, people planted trees, cultivated community gardens, installed solar panels, made buildings more efficient and implemented thousands
of other grassroots solutions to the climate crisis. We got to work everywhere in the world, but we need you, leaders, to get to work, too.

Thank you and God bless

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS136_KectilGeneration","The 25th session of the Conference Parties (COP25) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held from the 2 -13
December bringing together nearly 27000 people to the Spanish capital. COP25
provided parties with the opportunity to finalize the ""rulebook"" of the Paris
Agreement - the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020.


In the spirit of the convention on climate change young people continue to enjoy




                                                                          O
various spaces during COP mainly through YOU NGO; the official youth
constituency to the UNFCCC. Article 6 ofthe Convention and Article 12 of the
Paris Agreement referred to as Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) encourage
the empowerment of every member of the society to take climate actions and
therefore young people who are most vulnerable to the climate crisis are




                                             M
increasingly becoming the centre of discussion.


The world today is home to the largest generation of young people in history and
their energy, creativity, and innovation, when harnessed properly, will accelerate




                                           E
sustainable solutions to the global crisis. Youth have a pivotal role to play in the
implementation of ACE which consists of six elements namely: education,
training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and
international cooperation.




                             D
At COP25, the Intergenerational Inquiry which is a highlight event of Young and
Future Generations Day and like every year provided a platform for youth and
decision-makers to discuss how young people can enhance the implementation
of the Paris Agreement. This platform was attended by the Executive Secretary of
the UNFCCC and provided an opportunity for young people to share the
outcome on the Conference of Youth (COY 15) to the secretariat.


The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) has continued to
empower and mobilize young people at COP through our side events and
exhibitions. Through an exhibition at COP 25, AYICC was able to showcase the
actions and contributions of African youth in the fight against climate change.
Such actions include ecological restorations, renewable energy promotion, and
local conference of youth hosted by our national chapters.


AYICC's greatest concern however, is with regards to the low representation of
African youth at the UNFCCC sessions. There are many contributing factors which
includes lack of funding, inability to assess accreditations and visas. As the first
step in addressing this, we will continue to encourage African countries to make
conscious efforts to include youth delegates in their official delegations for COPs.
We also call on development partners and stakeholders who are interested in
youth development to reach out with their support to AYICC to enhance African
youth participation in this important global process.

Climate Change


• Campaigns and Advocacy
 The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is widely known for our
 incessant campaigns and research-based advocacy on environmental and
 climate change topics. Since 2006 AYICC has been consistent with its
 campaigns impressing on African governments and international community
 alike to deliver on their commitment under the United Nations Framework
 Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) .



• Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)
 Climate change education, training, and awareness creation have been the
 central focus of AYICC targeting youth and vulnerable communities. We do
 this through workshops, conferences, and webinars leveraging on our robust
 online presence. Through our Flagship program; the African Youth Conference
 on Climate Change (AFRIYOCC) we are able to provide a platform for




                                                                     O
 exchange of ideas and sharing of knowledge and best practices among young
 African thereby feeding into article 6 of the climate change convention and
 article 12 of the Paris Agreement.



• Tree planting and Ecological restoration



                                         M
 Trees contribute to their environment by providing oxygen, improving air
 quality, climate amelioration, conserving water, preserving soil, and




                                       E
 supporting wildlife. Beyond the campaigns and advocacies, our member
 organizations embark on tree planting and reforestation activities including
 mangrove restoration along the coast.




                         D
• Renewable energy promotion
 With the increasing demand for energy for industrial and economic
 development, AYICC member organizations in different countries are
 promoting renewable energy access to isolated off-grid communities. AYICC
 believes that Youth-led renewable energy enterprises are a viable means of
 achieving sustainable development, as they promote technologies that are
 less harmful to the global environs while at the same time providing
 sustainable income-generating opportunities for youth .



• Youth in Agribusiness
 AYICC sees agriculture as an essential driver of economic development and an
 area of great opportunity for young people in Africa. The challenge, however,
 is that the growing youth population does not see agriculture as a profitable
 opportunity due to their lack of insight into the opportunities that exist within
 the agriculture value chain. Through our member organizations who are youth
 farmers themselves, AYICC has adopted various strategies including outreach
 to schools and communities, exhibitions and youth agricultural festivals as
 well as institution of award schemes for best youth farmers as a way to raise
 interest and awareness on the opportunities that exist within this sector.



• Recycling

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS136_KectilGeneration","                            Over recent years, the world has witnessed an increasing level of waste
                            products as a by-product of the increasing level of population, affluence, and
                            technological advancement in a given environment or society. In Africa we
                            have witnessed increasing level of pollution from plastic, car tires, bottles
                            among others and this has generated innovative thinking among young
                            people to provide a sustainable solution. Over the years, AYICC members have
                            redefined waste as a resource for sustainable development and through
                            various recycling initiatives, they are bringing life into materials that otherwise
                            could have been a nuisance to the environment.

The 1st African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) convened from 26th - 27th
October, 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, on the theme “African Youth Responses to Climate
Change and Food Security, Action from the Frontline.” The conference was organized by Africa
Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) in partnership with Africa Climate Policy Center
(ACPC), New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), Pan African Climate Justice
Alliance (PACJA) and Zimbabwe United Nations Association (ZUNA).
100 youths selected across Africa in the conference addressing the thematic strands of Youth in
Agribusiness; Climate Change and Development in Africa; Sustainable Agriculture and Food
Security; Green Economy and Technology Transfer; Climate Justice and Human Rights; and
Climate Change and Disaster risk reduction participated in this first edition of the African Youth
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC). This came at a time when Africa as a continent
continues to bear the biggest brunt of climate change due to low resilience and weak capacities,
with the youth despite their huge numbers and innovativeness among the vulnerable alongside
women. Despite the odds, they have been actively engaged in adaptation and mitigation




                                                                   O
initiatives that improve their communities’ resilience to climate change.
The conference therefore provided a platform for the African youths to interact and share best
practices. Five flagship projects were selected to be used as case studies by African Youths in
starting their own projects depending on transferability. The conference also saw the drafting of

(AfriYOCC-2016)

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the environmental challenge of climate
change is already modifying Africa’s economies and livelihoods, health, social structure,
infrastructure and natural systems. Over the years, African youth have proved their potential in
both promoting and implementing climate change adaptation projects in their communities.
Their innovations have continually been adopted in responding to climate change impacts. This
is despite various challenges that include low capacity and education, high rates of poverty and
lack of financial resources. At the same time, African youth have been minimally represented in
the respective country policy processes as well as during the UNFCCC climate change
negotiations. Above 50% of the African population are the youth. This justifies the urgent need
for youth capacity development to respond to climate change and inclusion as key stakeholders
in policy process and negotiations. AYICC aims to spearhead new innovations, look into new
systems of success to share with policy and decision-makers, and generally aim to improve on
the current system which is causing long-term and irreversible degradation to our livelihoods –
as the leading youth organization on climate change in Africa.



                                                                    O

meeting will dilate on the current post 2015 development agenda and the role of young
people in championing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in
Africa.

The delegates shall have an opportunity to visit ongoing Climate Change adaptation and
agribusiness projects in Kenya for hands-on skills and knowledge replicable in their countries.
Consequently, it shall boost the skills and capacities of African youths to substantially contribute
to the process leading towards and during COP 22. Through partnership with both
Governmental and Non-governmental agencies, the conference shall not only negotiate for
more youth representation in the respective country policy processes towards the forthcoming
CoPs and country specific policies, but also provide learning and engagement opportunities for
African youths. This will greatly enhance their current capacity and potential to actively
participate in both national and international platforms for policy formulation and implementation.
The conference will also provide a platform to re-assess the current position of our negotiators
and create awareness about the critical role young people should play in shifting agendas in the
forthcoming Conference of Parties in Marrakech come November 2016. While a 4 day gathering

issues affecting their livelihoods.

African youth have for long been side-lined to the periphery of the substantive civic and policy
issues facing the continent. However, the worst affected are the rural based youths and those
residing in farming communities, peri-urban areas and those from conflict and post conflict
countries. This has resulted in youths from these marginalized communities having no
knowledge and information on the basic climate change science and adaptation and mitigation
mechanisms. The good news though is that there is capacity amongst many young people who
are already in the circles of upcoming academia, policy specialists, lawyers, journalists and
scientists’ alike. These capacities need to be strengthened and skills shared amongst the wider
group of young people on the continent so that best practices are disseminated and resources
are expanded.

While it is an undeniable fact that climate change is affecting all regions globally, especially in
developing countries, the adverse effects in the future is likely to increase if the Paris agreement
is not ratified and effectuated by all parties. And even though a deal was achieved during
COP21 in Paris, the impacts of climate change will definitely continue into the future. This
suggests that young people will have to not just understand what climate change is and how it is




                                                                      O
affecting our world, opportunities that exists within, but most importantly, participate actively into
finding amicable solutions. Young people of Africa have therefore considered it an inherent
imperative to contribute to their future by organizing the 2nd African Youth Conference on
Climate Change in October 2016 under the theme, ‘Making Climate Finance work for




                                                  M
African Youth.’


2.1 CONFERENCE STRATEGY




                                                E
The conference program shall be based on exploring mechanisms to finance climate adaptation
and mitigation through Innovations in agriculture, technology and other sectors. It shall be




                                     D
highly interactive with unique workshop-style design that enables participants to develop their
potential through practical experience. Participants will divide to participate in thematic
workshops and come up with an African Youth position paper and concrete activities to be
included in the African Youth Strategy on Climate Change.

The delegates shall be engaged in pre-conference activities that shall include and not limited to,
mapping of youth climate change and/or mitigation projects within the conference key focus
areas for selection as best practice and include in the African youth climate change adaptation
and mitigation best practices database and handbook and aggressively fundraise towards their
participation and a successful workshop. The conference shall critically examine the various
country positions and the overall continents positions of the African Group of Negotiators, their
achievements and potentials towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It shall
examine the youth voices in these positions and further develop African youth position for
COP22.

We expect 200 youth leaders to participate in this conference. The conference is convened by
the AYICC continental secretariat in collaboration with AYICC Kenya chapter and the member

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is an umbrella youth network of African
based youth organizations, university groups, rural youth groups, schools, and individuals
working on climate change and sustainable development issues. It aims at developing capacity
and strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent need to take action
against the impacts of climate change for both present and future generations.

The initiative (always referred to as the movement) was conceived in Nairobi Kenya 10 years
ago, during the second Conference of Youth (COY2) preceding the 12th Conference of Parties
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC - COP12). The
main reason for its founding was to ensure the inclusion, and active participation of youths from
the south, and specifically Africa, in the international climate change negotiations. This was
needed as the youth are more than half the African population and are most affected by climate
change impacts. They also got massive potential to support the continent to take action on
global warming.

During its formation, it comprised of 8 country chapters and current has grown to 45 country
chapters with over 20,000 members across Africa and the Diaspora. This initiative has provided




                                                                  O
a platform for knowledge, ideas and experiences sharing. It is also an avenue for development
of skills and strategies on youth action on climate change mitigation and adaptation in the
African continent. AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a
platform for them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the




                                               M
UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others.

Since its inception, we have worked in partnership with international youth movements and have




                                             E
played a great role in the establishment of the International Youth Climate Movement whose
youth member organizations are now officially acknowledged by the UNFCCC as the YOUNGO
(Youth NGOs involved in the climate change negotiations process). Since COY2 in Nairobi, it




                                   D
has had youth delegates’ representation in all COP meetings.

In addition to the above, we have had landmark successes that include:
     A reach out programme for a children’s home (Watoto Wema in Ruai) and School
        climate change education program run in selected schools in Kenya.
     Leadership and mentorship programmes especially on volunteerism.
     Community development projects particularly on clean energy (energy saving stoves for
        rural folks)
     Capacity development of youth on agribusiness
     Advocacy campaigns e.g. lobbied for lanes to be set aside along the major highways for
        non-motorised transport especially for cyclists.
     Policy engagements i.e. contributing to the climate change bill 2012,as stakeholders
     Youth Caravan from Kenya to Durban during COP 17

To develop capacity and strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent
need to take action against the impacts of climate change for both present and future
generations.
3.2 Our Vision

An African continent with an empowered and united youth, who are proactively involved in the
decision-making processes and in the adoption of sustainable options towards a better climate
and social equity.


3.3 Our Core Objectives

a) To provide a platform for young people in the African Countries to engage in dialogue and
share experiences with regard to youth participation in climate change and sustainable
development.
b) To advocate and lobby for pro-active representation and participation of youth in climate




                                                                O
change and sustainable development activities at a local, national and international level.
c) To build partnerships and mobilize resources for youth and youth organizations to actively
participate in the implementation of climate change response strategies and projects in their
member countries.




                                              M
d) Play a leading role in promoting and implementing climate change education and research,
adaptation and mitigation in Africa.
e) Initiate and support youth leadership processes by creating a platform for transfer of




                                            E
leadership skills and principles of transparent governance.


3.4 Our strategic priorities in achieving these objectives:

   
   
   
   
   
       Policy dialogues

       Communication and Education
       Precaution strategies
                                  D
       Networking and partnerships, including South/South and South/North


       Research, Advocacy and Action Learning

Our charter (Charter of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change) can be found on
www.ayicc.net.
Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any
financial assistance, the greatest resource being the time and skills that the leadership
committee and members contribute. However, in order to scale up our actions and make AYICC
vision a reality, there is need for more human and financial resources.

African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) 2016

African Youth Conference on Climate Change will take place in Nairobi in Kenya. The conference is organized by the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change
(AYICC) and the African Climate Policy Centre from the 10 to 13 October 2016. AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its fonmation in 2006 during the second
Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12.

African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) www.ayicc.net is a continental youth network that was conceived in 2006 in Nairobi Kenya, during the
Conference of Youth held just before the UNFCCC COP12. This initiative has continued to link, and share knowledge, ideas, experiences, skills and strategies
on youth action around the continent on climate change, its mitigation and adaptation and sustainable development. In 2009, AYICC was granted observer
status to the African Minister Conference on Environment (AMCEN). AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a platform for
them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the Conference of Parties of UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others. AYICC
currently operates in over 45 African countries with over 20,000 members.

In response, to the call by AU Heads of Sates and Government to establish the CAHOSCC Youth Programme on Climate Change (CYPCC),
(Assembly/AU/Dec.538{XXIII}) and cognizant of the key role played by African youths in climate change mitigation and adaptation and overall sustainable
development. AYICC is convening the Second African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) from the 10 to 13 October 2016, after the successful
hosting of the first edition held from 26th to 27th October 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimababwe.       ~


AfriYOCC 2016, shall provide an avenue for African youths to showcase their climate change adaptation
and mitigation strategies, projects and initiatives. Best practices arising from the various AYICC country
chapters shall be showcased and the African youth climate change adaptation and mitigation best
practices data base and handbook launched .

Founding Opportunities


AYICC Founding Opportunities

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the
environmental challenge of climate change will ultimately modify Africa's economies and livelihoods, health, social structure, infrastructure and natural
systems. To date little has been done to empower, capacitate and mobilise youth, particularly in Africa to address global environmental challenges such as
climate change. facebook d o w n ~ To remedy this, an initial step has been the formation of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC).

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change was formed partially in response to the poor representation of young Africans at the International Youth
Summit on Climate Change (November 24-28, 2005), which was held in conjunction with the United Nation's Climate Change Conference (November 28-
December 10, 2005) in Montreal , Canada. The overall mission of AYICC is to ensure that African youth are equipped toparticipate in future UNFCCC
meetings and other global initiatives for sustainable solutions to environmental degradation and climate change.

In order to ensure a strong youth presence in climate change dialogue and fora, there is a need for AYICC to ensure youth representation from various parts
of Africa. This will enable Africa's youth to engage with the global youth movement, governments and NGO's in a more coordinated and sustained manner.
The long term goal is to ensure sustainable and systematic global youth action, with special emphasis on African youth on the issue of climate change.

Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any financial assistance. The planning committee members have
volunteered their time and their contributions. However, in order to make this vision a reality we need to become a financially viable organisation. For this
reason, we would like to request your financial assistance in getting this vision off the ground.•

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE OPENING FORUM OF THE SEVENTH AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FORUM, 12TH OCTOBER

2010: Ms. Esther Agbarakwe, Nigeria




The Chair,

Climate Change poses significant challenges to future generations. As youth we have a stake in this future; it is our future.




                                                                                                                 O
As the 7th African Development Forum, we have indeed come of age, we are no longer in our childhood stages of determining sustainable development - the
time of maturity has arrived. This year is marked as the International Year of Youth and now, more than ever before, the youth are taking a stand. More than
anyone else, we, the Youth, face unprecedented challenges as a result of global climate change. We also share the responsibility of addressing ii. As a group,
we are key moral stakeholders in the international processes treating the most important challenge of our generation. As it is our future, we will be
disproportionately affected by the catastrophic impacts of climate change.

Advocacy and Behavior Change: II is critical for present and future leaders to collaborate on finding solutions. The need for cultural transformation in our time




                                                                              M
is stronger than ever. This transformation - that enables us to shift towards a more sustainable world - should be an organic process, guided by principles of
compassion, integrity and justice. We need to pragmatically rethink our behavioral patterns, to enable a paradigm shift that is based on an ongoing process of
action, reflection and meaningful participation. Awareness, education and empowerment are fundamental prerequisites to enabling this process, and the youth
are energetic and passionate about holding governments and all relevant stakeholders involved accountable for their actions. We are equal partners in this
process and commit ourselves fully to achieving the objectives as decided by this Forum.




                                                                            E
Contrary to what is believed; young people play a dynamic role in framing and implementing policies. So their role goes beyond advocacy. From an advocacy
perspective, young people are involved in songs and stories which spread awareness in local languages. Of course we understand the importance and
relevance of this because 70% of Africa is based in rural areas and the term Climate Change is foreign, Young people are finding ways of using words in local
languages to translate the message across.




                                                           D
It is time to shift the balance of decision-making towards the generation that will have to manage this unwanted inheritance, to make political and economic
decisions that can span a generation, and to enable real inter-generational and inter-cultural dialogue about climate change to be realized in institutions where
the youth generation can learn.

However at the same time a range of social learning and marketing approaches need to be developed to address the gap between classroom education styles
and education that stimulates real action. This gap prevents the cultural shift from token awareness to personal action and reaction.

Education: In relation to climate change, African Governments should begin at inception to mainstream youth voices and perceptions. This is particularly
important because climate change projections indicate that effects will begin to be most felt in the next 20-30 years - young people should begin to be part of
the solution so that they will be able to cope when disaster calls. Involving them in this programme will ensure that those who will be affected will have direct
knowledge of the challenges and strategies for coping as well as the ability to mobilize communities to respond to and prepare for the impact of climate change
and natural disasters.

Governments must give credence to the higher learning education system in Africa in particular the increased accent on improvement of research and
innovation on climate change specifically highlighting on policy and reform, the programmes, pedagogy and teaching tools. This will enhance an equipped pool
of intellectual capital among the young people on climate change issues who will replicate this to the various organizations and networks that they are part of.

Al government level, during the last Conference of the Parties (COP), ii was pleasing to see that many African delegations included youth and gave them a role
to play. Furthermore, many youth who were involved in COP 15 deliberations have been interacting with their various governments and engaging in processes
and procedures that are related to Climate change policy. There is an understanding that more needs to be done, and at this forum, I urge you to engage young
people who knock on your doors asking to be involved.

Youth and youth based NGOs play a major role either in strengthening local capacity to cope or by supporting local action. Already, groups such as the Nigerian
Youth Coalition and the African youth Climate Initiative-Kenya have established school climate clubs, which are creative ways to engage young people; these
initiatives should be mainstreamed into education systems. Young people in this governance process are important because successful adaptation requires a
host of innovative measures developed with vulnerable communities to improve their present and future livelihoods. Young people are vibrant and are able to
access places that many governmental institutions fail to access. As the majority of the population and Africa's future, it is important to include them in this
impending crisis that is Climate Change.

Already, this conference calls for integrated approaches to enable African countries to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change. There is a dire need
to have a clearer understanding of the potential calamities that climate change can bring and to start the discourse on how best to stave off the worst impacts.
There is already an understanding that

Climate Change is not a localized problem but transcends national borders, hence the need for co-operation of Intergovernmental agencies but also to include
those young and vulnerable people.

Conclusion :
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS143_AfricanYouthCouncilonClimateChange","No longer can climate change be seen as merely an environmental problem or an energy challenge. It is a combination of both, which needs the involvement of
young people to preserve the environment and enter into green energy careers.

It's important for all of us to recognize that sustainable development isn't just a catch phrase - people all over the continent are taking it into their own hands. A
couple days ago over 300 community events took place in nearly every country on the continent of Africa, and more than 7000 globally as part of the Global
Work Party on 10/10/10.

Everywhere in the wortd, people planted trees, cultivated community gardens, installed solar panels, made buildings more efficient and implemented thousands
of other grassroots solutions to the climate crisis. We got to work everywhere in the world, but we need you, leaders, to get to work, too.

Thank you and God bless

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS143_AfricanYouthCouncilonClimateChange","The 25th session of the Conference Parties (COP25) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held from the 2 -13
December bringing together nearly 27000 people to the Spanish capital. COP25
provided parties with the opportunity to finalize the ""rulebook"" of the Paris
Agreement - the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020.


In the spirit of the convention on climate change young people continue to enjoy




                                                                          O
various spaces during COP mainly through YOU NGO; the official youth
constituency to the UNFCCC. Article 6 ofthe Convention and Article 12 of the
Paris Agreement referred to as Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) encourage
the empowerment of every member of the society to take climate actions and
therefore young people who are most vulnerable to the climate crisis are




                                             M
increasingly becoming the centre of discussion.


The world today is home to the largest generation of young people in history and
their energy, creativity, and innovation, when harnessed properly, will accelerate




                                           E
sustainable solutions to the global crisis. Youth have a pivotal role to play in the
implementation of ACE which consists of six elements namely: education,
training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and
international cooperation.




                             D
At COP25, the Intergenerational Inquiry which is a highlight event of Young and
Future Generations Day and like every year provided a platform for youth and
decision-makers to discuss how young people can enhance the implementation
of the Paris Agreement. This platform was attended by the Executive Secretary of
the UNFCCC and provided an opportunity for young people to share the
outcome on the Conference of Youth (COY 15) to the secretariat.


The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) has continued to
empower and mobilize young people at COP through our side events and
exhibitions. Through an exhibition at COP 25, AYICC was able to showcase the
actions and contributions of African youth in the fight against climate change.
Such actions include ecological restorations, renewable energy promotion, and
local conference of youth hosted by our national chapters.


AYICC's greatest concern however, is with regards to the low representation of
African youth at the UNFCCC sessions. There are many contributing factors which
includes lack of funding, inability to assess accreditations and visas. As the first
step in addressing this, we will continue to encourage African countries to make
conscious efforts to include youth delegates in their official delegations for COPs.
We also call on development partners and stakeholders who are interested in
youth development to reach out with their support to AYICC to enhance African
youth participation in this important global process.

Climate Change


• Campaigns and Advocacy
 The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is widely known for our
 incessant campaigns and research-based advocacy on environmental and
 climate change topics. Since 2006 AYICC has been consistent with its
 campaigns impressing on African governments and international community
 alike to deliver on their commitment under the United Nations Framework
 Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) .



• Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)
 Climate change education, training, and awareness creation have been the
 central focus of AYICC targeting youth and vulnerable communities. We do
 this through workshops, conferences, and webinars leveraging on our robust
 online presence. Through our Flagship program; the African Youth Conference
 on Climate Change (AFRIYOCC) we are able to provide a platform for




                                                                     O
 exchange of ideas and sharing of knowledge and best practices among young
 African thereby feeding into article 6 of the climate change convention and
 article 12 of the Paris Agreement.



• Tree planting and Ecological restoration



                                         M
 Trees contribute to their environment by providing oxygen, improving air
 quality, climate amelioration, conserving water, preserving soil, and




                                       E
 supporting wildlife. Beyond the campaigns and advocacies, our member
 organizations embark on tree planting and reforestation activities including
 mangrove restoration along the coast.




                         D
• Renewable energy promotion
 With the increasing demand for energy for industrial and economic
 development, AYICC member organizations in different countries are
 promoting renewable energy access to isolated off-grid communities. AYICC
 believes that Youth-led renewable energy enterprises are a viable means of
 achieving sustainable development, as they promote technologies that are
 less harmful to the global environs while at the same time providing
 sustainable income-generating opportunities for youth .



• Youth in Agribusiness
 AYICC sees agriculture as an essential driver of economic development and an
 area of great opportunity for young people in Africa. The challenge, however,
 is that the growing youth population does not see agriculture as a profitable
 opportunity due to their lack of insight into the opportunities that exist within
 the agriculture value chain. Through our member organizations who are youth
 farmers themselves, AYICC has adopted various strategies including outreach
 to schools and communities, exhibitions and youth agricultural festivals as
 well as institution of award schemes for best youth farmers as a way to raise
 interest and awareness on the opportunities that exist within this sector.



• Recycling

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS143_AfricanYouthCouncilonClimateChange","                            Over recent years, the world has witnessed an increasing level of waste
                            products as a by-product of the increasing level of population, affluence, and
                            technological advancement in a given environment or society. In Africa we
                            have witnessed increasing level of pollution from plastic, car tires, bottles
                            among others and this has generated innovative thinking among young
                            people to provide a sustainable solution. Over the years, AYICC members have
                            redefined waste as a resource for sustainable development and through
                            various recycling initiatives, they are bringing life into materials that otherwise
                            could have been a nuisance to the environment.

About Our Campus
The ALA Campus is a beautiful space on the outskirts of Johannesburg.
Since taking occupation 10 years ago and with the generous support of our
donors purchasing the property, we've been investing heavily. We engaged
with a design team with the aim of designing a residential space to house
students and faculty as well as a Library for the Future of Africa.
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS001_ALA","We now have a living document called the ALA's Campus Master Plan,
which is a process and framework for what ALA will be doing with our
learning space over the next 20 years and beyond.

In 2015, we broke ground on the first big project- The newly constructed
residential wings include that form part of the new Nelson Mandela
Residence with 48 Student dorm room, 4 Faculty family home, 10 Faculty
apartments, 2 Large courtyards, 2 Laundry facilities, 4 Shared lounges and
2 Sick bays!

In 2016 we began building The Pardee Learning Commons, the second
construction project on campus, which will redesign and redefine our
learning spaces, positioning ALA as a model for 21st century teaching and
learning.

We have built an online coffee table book that tracks the story and progress
as we build our campus master plan. We highly recommend you visit it,
particularly the timeline and projects sections.



   Below is the virtual tour of our latest campus project the Fred Pardee
                             Learning Commons.

  Fees & Financial
  Assistance
  ALA is one of the most prestigious education institutions in the world, with a
  unique financial model designed to enable us to identify, develop and connect
  Africa's future leaders. Everyone who applies and is then admitted to ALA,
  regardless of financial background or nationality, is eligible to receive significant
  financial assistance* in the form of scholarships and loans towards studying at
  ALA and accessing membership to our lifelong network. The cost of tuition at
  ALA is USD $30,900 per year.

  At ALA, the value of financial awards is determined after admissions decisions
  have been made. Fees charged to a given student will be based on a family's
  financial means. We expect that every family will stretch themselves to finance
  the ALA education, just as we ask ALA's network of supporters from around the
  world to stretch themselves to ensure that every admitted student is able to
  attend. Students from more financially disadvantaged backgrounds receive more
  significant financial assistance from ALA, and families with more resources are
  expected to contribute more to their child's education at ALA.

  Every student will sign the ALA Social Contract - a commitment to contribute to
  peace and prosperity on the continent for at least 10 years in return for the
  financial assistance provided by our community.

Executive
Seminars
Executive Seminars
are more intimate
workshops with
smaller groups of
interested students,
covering specialized
subjects. Seminars
are held
approximately once
every two weeks.
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS001_ALA","Topics of Executive
Seminars in the past
have included a
working session on
proposals to the
Global Fund for HIV
run by former
chairperson of the
Global Fund, Wilfred
Griekspoor, a
session on
the Power of
Storytelling, an all-
women panel
on Women in
Entertainment and
Media.

ALA actively
connects its young
leaders to global
platforms such as
the Aspen Institute,
the World Economic
Forum, the Clinton
Global Initiative and
TED, where our
young leaders share
their ideas for
Africa's
transformation and
foster the
connections that will
enable them to
translate vision to
action. Each year,
over 100 students
get to attend
conferences with
renowned leaders in
Africa and around
the world.

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS001_ALA","African Leadership
Academy seeks to
transform Africa by
developing a
powerful network of
over 6,000 leaders
who will work
together to address
Africa's greatest
challenges, achieve
extraordinary social
impact, and
accelerate the
continent's growth
trajectory.
Africa's greatest
need is ethical and
entrepreneurial
leadership. Too
often, we only invest
in addressing the
symptoms of poor
leadership in Africa:
we give blankets,
food, and medicine
to those impacted
by war, poverty, and
famine. But these
efforts will never
stop unless we
develop leaders who
prevent wars,
entrepreneurs who
create jobs, and
innovators that
develop lasting

solutions to the root
causes of Africa's
problems. We aim to
develop the future
Nelson Mandela, the
next Wangari
Maathai, and the
African Bill Gates.

We comb Africa for
youth who show the
spark of initiative;
who see what can
be and strive to
make it so.


Example: After
losing a friend to
Cholera, young
leader Solomon
Martey from Ghana
invented a borehole
machine using
spare parts to pump,
purify, and distribute
water in his village.
His machine has
since been adopted
by the Ghanaian
Ministry of

rolled out in several
other rural villages
across Ghana.

     INTRODUCTION TO THE ALA SOCIAL CONTRACT AND FORGIVABLE LOAN

Introduction
The following memo is a guide to your financial assistance award. After reading this memo you should have clarity
and understanding of:

    1.   Our Guiding Principles
    2.   What the ALA Social Contract is
    3.   What your ALA tuition fees entail
    4.   What the terms of the financial assistance agreement mean
    5.   What the deferment process entails
    6.   Who to contact should you have comments or queries


1. Our Guiding Principles

At African Leadership Academy, we believe that financial circumstances should not impede a student from reaching
their full potential, and should not rob Africa of its most promising talent. When we admitted you to ALA, we made
a statement about our belief in your potential to transform the continent, and about our commitment to empower
you on your leadership journey.

If you and your family cannot afford or independently finance your education at ALA, we have, through the
generosity of our donors, made institutional loans available to you. Our loans, unlike almost any other loan you may
seek, are forgivable if you meet the terms of your financial assistance agreement, because our loans are a social
contract between you and the entire ALA community.

2. The ALA Social Contract

A social contract is an agreement for mutual benefit between an individual or group and the government, an
organisation or community as a whole. At ALA, donors, parents, students, alumni, and staffulty come together to
support ALA’s mission to promote lasting peace and shared prosperity on the African continent. We do this by
identifying, developing, and connecting the next generation of African leaders. Under ALA’s model, students’
financial circumstances are not considered during the admissions process (we have “need-blind admissions”), and all
admitted students can receive need-based financial assistance in the form of a forgivable loan to ensure they can
attend the Academy.

The ALA forgivable loan agreement is a social contract entered into between the incoming student and the entire
ALA community. The members of our community have come, and continue to come together, in order to develop
leaders for the continent. Therefore, the loan is forgiven for the alumni that return to have impact on the continent
for at least 10 years after their 25th birthday (or from the moment they complete their undergraduate degree,
whichever comes first).

ALA is not expecting you to fulfil your part of the social contract on your own. We have made a lifelong
commitment to the development of your career, and have established the Department of Lifelong Engagement to
assist you in your career development.

3. What Your Tuition Fees Entail

The total cost of attending ALA is split between your student contribution and your proposed ALA financial
assistance award. You will pay your contribution to fees during your time on campus at ALA, per the payment

structure provided by ALA Finance. If you choose to accept our financial assistance award, ALA will cover the
difference between your expected student contribution and ALA’s full tuition through a financial assistance award.
Our financial assistance award is an option for you, not an obligation. You must let us know if you choose to accept
it, or if you will find other means to cover the gap between your expected student contribution and ALA’s full
tuition.

If you choose to accept ALA’s financial assistance please read below to understand the terms of your Financial
Assistance Agreement.

Please note that financial assistance is optional, therefore this section may not be applicable to all students

4. Understanding Key Terms in Your Financial Assistance Award Agreement

During the Admissions process of enrolment at ALA, you will sign two key documents, namely:

     1. The ALA Enrolment Contract; and
     2. ALA Financial Assistance Award Agreement (Optional)


The ALA Financial Assistance Award Agreement contains key terms which require thorough understanding. Below
is a summary of the key terms and their interpretations:

Forgivable Loan

A forgivable loan is a form of a loan in which its entirety, or a portion of it, can be forgiven by the lender when
certain conditions are met. However, if the conditions are not met, the loan has to be repaid, usually with interest.
ALA’s financial assistance is structured this way to honour the promise under which ALA’s past and present donors
chose to support ALA, namely, to develop leaders who will develop the African continent. The interpretation of this
statement has been, and continues to be, that our young leaders will have the most impact on the continent by being
present on the continent. Therefore, the loan is forgivable on condition of your physical return and residence on the
continent.


3.2 Establish residence and employment in Africa for a period of 10 years

The interpretation of ‘employment’ has been broadened to mean ‘reside in Africa’. This means that as long as you
are physically present on the African continent, ALA will assume your residence to also mean you are positively
contributing economically and socially to the African continent. Entrepreneurial ventures, part-time or full-time
employment, pursuing any post-graduate education – (such as graduate school, a second degree, a PhD, etc.) will
also count to fulfil the terms of your contract. Your mere presence in Africa is enough. Please note that the
abovementioned examples are not exhaustive.

You are required to be physically present on the African continent for a minimum of 10 years to qualify for the full
loan forgiveness. Every year you spend on the African continent after your undergraduate degree counts toward
forgiveness. 1/10th of your loan will be forgiven every year you spend on the African continent, meaning that by the
end of the 10th year, your loan will be fully forgiven.

Please note that as a general rule, any time spent on the African continent prior to age 25 or before completing your
undergraduate degree will not count towards forgiveness. Gap years, starting a venture before (or instead of going
to) college, complete internships, etc., may be considered towards your Return To Africa commitment on a case-by-
case basis.

3.3 Principal amount and accrued interest

Principal Amount: The original loan amount borrowed.

Accrued Interest: The growing amount charged by the lender (ALA) to a borrower (the student) for the cost of
borrowing.



3.4 [Interest is] compounded annually

Compounded interest arises when interest is added to the principal amount of a loan, so that the interest that has
been added to the loan also accrues interest. In a way, compounded interest can be thought of as “interest on
interest,” and can be contrasted with simple interest, which is interest calculated only on the principal loan amount.

Your financial assistance loan begins accruing interest immediately after your studies at ALA begin and continues to
do so until the loan is forgiven or paid in full. The interest rate for your loan is set at 18% per year.


5. Applying for Deferment

Should you wish to postpone your return to the African continent after your 25th birthday, you have the option of
deferment available to you. A deferment allows you to choose to postpone repayment on your loan for a specified
period for residency reasons.
You may choose deferment in the following instances:
     Further education
     Job/Research opportunities which are unavailable or rare on the African continent
     Job/Research opportunities which will uniquely prepare you for your career on the African continent
     Job/Research opportunities whose impact has a strong and direct link to the development of the African
        continent
     Unforeseen circumstances such as: unemployment on the African continent, personal and/or extenuating
        circumstances

Please note: the abovementioned examples are not exhaustive. Deferment will be granted on a case by case basis.

The interest on the loan will continue to accrue during the deferment period. You must apply for deferment if you
are planning to reside out of Africa (for any reason) after your 25th birthday. To apply for deferment, you will need
to submit a deferment application form, motivational letter and additional documentation (where required) to
studentloans@africanleadershipacademy.org. A panel will then review your application, and provide your results
within 3 weeks.

 6. Accessing Your Loan Details
The ALA Finance Office will inform you about your loan details via annual statements. Alternatively, you may
contact the ALA Finance Office via email at studentloans@africanleadershipacademy.org for any loan-related
queries you may have.

exciting,"" says Luzuko. ""Especially in 2019 with so many great memories, such
as the Annual Business Summit that had two winners from Cape Town.""

The growth of the Network in Cape Town hasn't been easy, particularly given
their spatial distance from the Alumni headquarters in Johannesburg.
However, the members remained focused and committed and together with
support from colleagues such as Nehwoh Belinda and Warren Radebe, they
were able to create and sustain a vibrant and engaging Alumni community.
Luzuko is particularly grateful for the comradery on the annual Alumni Day,
where all members get an opportunity to network and catch up.

The Young Urban Men and Women programmes remain a favourite as it
provides a safe space for both genders to engage on issues relating to, among
other things, youth sexual and reproductive health. This year, members faced
an unexpected challenge as a result of Covid-19, but are continuing to give
back to the community, help others to stay safe and engage as a network.

  A SUCCESSFUL BERTIE LUBNER LEGACY WEEK
                                        2020
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS004_AfrikaTikkun","The Bertie Lubner Legacy Week continues to inspire young people to follow in the
footsteps of this philanthropic giant, whose legacy still echoes in our hearts. Once
again, the Alumni Network organized vibrant and educational events at all our
centres.

We had over 100 volunteers eager to give their time to local organizations and
schools participating in the Legacy Week. Among these were Childline, Autism
South Africa and lthlokomeleng Old Age Home.

As is the custom, the week kicked off with the launch of the Legacy Museums,
curated exhibitions of the life and times of Bertie Lubner. This served as an
important reminder of the difficult social context within which Bertie Lubner
sought to make change. It's no wonder his incredible achievements continue to
motivate our young people. This year, our members got busy with community
service, painting, cleaning the centres and preparing food for our elderly.

The entire week was an unforgettable movement, providing an opportunity for our
members to give back in the spirit of responsible kindness.

HISTORY OF AFRIKA
TIKKUN
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS004_AfrikaTikkun","We were founded in 1994 by the late Chief Rabbi Cyril Harris and
Philanthropist/Businessman Dr Bertie Lubner. Initially, the day to day
needs of children was a priority but soon after, the organisation
evolved into one focused on overall development. Renamed
MaAfrika Tikkun and later Afrika Tikkun, our approach was refined
and reformulated into the Cradle to Career 360° model. This Model is
aimed at providing education, health and social services to young
people and their families through centres of excellence in South
African townships. Our main goal is to create a sustainable future for
the youth of South Africa and the credibility of this cause won the
support of the organisations Patron-in-Chief in memoriam, Nelson
Mandela. Since then, we have built 4 centres of excellence across
Gauteng and 1 in the Western Cape.

The primary objective of Afrika Tikkun is to provide holistic development i1
disadvantaged communities. We aim to empower young people by affording then
the opportunity to receive gainful education, good health care, nutrition ani
support for their families. In doing so, we equalise the playing field for unprivilegec
young people so that they have the same employment opportunities that privilege<
youth have. We offer a number of programmes that ensure an all rounded perso1
as the outcome. Our 360 degree Model of care consists of three programmei
namely: Early Childhood Development, Child and Youth Development, and Caree
Development. Additionally, we have programmes which support our 360 degre1
Model, namely: Family Support Services, Primary Health Care, The Empowermen
Programme, and Nutrition and Food Security Programme.

                     Over the last 25 years, Afrika Tikkun’s vision has been to enable the economic

                     that make it difficult for them to break away from the cycle of poverty.

                  original Patrons. They were not only supportive to Afrika
                  Tikkun, but visited the Centres and gave of their love to the
                  Afrika Tikkun team. The Ronnie and Rhona Lubner Centre in
                  Alexandra Township will forever stand as a tribute to their
                  involvement.

                  In conclusion, I must acknowledge one of the finest groups
                  of executives that I have ever had the privilege of working
                  with. Their commitment, late nights and long hours
                  (including over weekends), reflects a passion for excellence
                  that is noteworthy. My team have learnt to complement
                  one another and take initiative, displaying a drive that most
                  CEO’s can only dream of. It has been my honour to lead a
                  team dedicated to responsible kindness expressed in their
                  work and social lives.

                  Marc Lubner
                  Chief Executive Officer

                   The primary objective of Afrika Tikkun is therefore to reduce youth unemployment and child poverty in South
                   Africa by tackling the socio-economic drivers that make it difficult for young people to access the economy as
                   productive citizens.

                   We achieve this by providing comprehensive and integrated

                   through every stage of development until they emerge as a
                   young educated, value-based, career-driven and employable
                   young adult capable of accessing the economy in real time
                   (our Cradle to Career 360º model). We support them further
                   through our specialised/vocational skills development and
                   career placement programmes with the ultimate objective
                   of actively progressing them into employment or self-
                   employment.

                 Our Cradle to Career 360º model sets the foundation for all our core programmes and is our commitment to supporting young
                 people from infancy into adulthood and ultimately employment, so that they become economically empowered.

                 The model allows us to provide comprehensive development interventions for our young people, their families and the community
                 at large. In order to provide services and interventions that support young people from cradle to career, our programmes, focus
                 on the specific developmental and age-appropriate needs of young people aged 2-29 years. These services are divided into core
                 and support programmes namely:

                    HIGHLIGHTS
     • The Grade R School Readiness Assessment, administered
       at all centres, presented the best outcome to date, in
       that 73% of Afrika Tikkun Grade R children achieved
       school readiness
     • The Toy Library project undertaken in collaboration with
       Cotlands resulted in each centre employing a trained Toy

       Librarian. The toys and equipment received are utilised
       by the ECD learners at the centre itself, as well as other
       ECD centres within close proximity on an outreach basis.
     • In partnership with Brainwaves, Competency Based
       Assessments of all ECD teachers and assistants were
       undertaken at each centre. This resulted in training
       recommendations that commenced in 2018 and are
       being continued in 2019.
     • The Play Every Day project in partnership with Sesame
       Workshop and the Lego Foundation that started in
       2016, reached the intervention phase during 2018.
       120 Parent/Caregivers/Child pairs were reached with
       12 Play Workshops at all centres.

                              SINDI SHINES WITH TLC
                 Sindi is 5 years old and lives with her mother and 3 siblings
                 near the Mfuleni centre. She was diagnosed with a lung
                 condition that causes her to use a breathing aid 24/7. When
                 Sindi joined our ECD programme, Empowerment case
                 administrators encouraged the family to join the support
                 group for parents of children with disabilities.




                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       29
                 Sindi’s first months in the programme were tough as she
                 was overly hyperactive and disrupted the class often. Her
                 hyperactivity meant that her breathing aid needed to be
                 cleaned continuously.

                 Her teachers encouraged her to focus her energy on
                 creative art, painting and puzzles. With the aid of Lego
                 Blocks and daily reading, they slowly began to develop
                 her cognitive skills. Additionally, Sindi’s breathing aid was
                 cleaned regularly to improve her lung condition.

                 Through the combined efforts of the ECD teachers,
                 Empowerment case workers and Primary Health Care
                 workers, Sindi has been doing well in her daily activities                                                                       After months of continuous support and
                 and has not had any issues regarding breathing.

                      unable to communicate with her. This continued until I                                                                           placed in a learnership in the Hospitality Industry.

                      neighbouring community. At this time, I was 19 and doing my

                      whomever I wanted to be, but it won’t be easy.

                      In 2011, I passed matric with a bachelor’s, which made my
                      mother proud. I had never seen my family so happy, maybe
                      it’s because I’m the eldest of my siblings. The following three
                      years I was in and out of jobs, which was extremely frustrating.
                      I knew the solution was to enrol for a course that would
                      help me develop myself. I attended college thinking I was
                      on the right track but I became friends with people who had
                      a negative impact on my life. I stopped attending classes and

                      Lulama*, a 15-year-old girl was born HIV-positive. Her younger brother, Sipho* is
                      9 years old and they both attend primary school. Three years ago, Lulama’s HIV-
                      positive mother fell ill. She was in and out of hospital before she finally passed away.
                      The children were left without a caregiver. During that time, Lulama stopped taking
                      her medication and was admitted to hospital. She lost a lot of weight and her diet
                      was very poor, affecting her attendance and performance at school. The children
                      were referred to Afrika Tikkun.

                      Through Afrika Tikkun’s intervention, the children’s maternal uncle decided to
                      take them in. Afrika Tikkun equipped the uncle and his wife with parenting skills,

                      knowing that they had to take care of two children of their own. “We also supported
                      the family with food parcels and other donations. We made sure Lulama was taking
                      her treatment. We also taught the aunt how to care for a child with HIV”.

                      Lulama attends Afrika Tikkun every day – where she receives a healthy meal and
                      plenty of emotional and academic support. In recognition of how much she has
                      progressed and matured, she was selected to attend a leadership camp.

                      *not their real names


                      “I learnt a lot from that experience. I really appreciate what Afrika Tikkun has done for my family and me”,
                      she says. She is now taking her medication and is on a healthy diet. She is a healthy and happy child. Her
                      class teacher also reports that she is doing well at school.

                      happiness flashes away and is replaced by fear of the
                      unknown. I got on the plane, and realised there was nothing
                      to be afraid of. We arrived in Dusseldorf and met two
                      fantastic mothers who took us for a tour.

                      There were many beautiful places we visited. I could spend
                      the whole day sharing how fun it was.

                      Everyone I met there was great, generous and welcoming.
                      This experience has really changed my life for the better, I
                      saw that the world is big enough for me to reach my dreams
                      and dream beyond Diepsloot.

                      I would like to thank all the people who have contributed to
                      our visit. I am grateful for their time, financial - and any other
                      support.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       51
                 being in such an expensive restaurant. When I boarded
                 the plane my heart thumped with excitement, and when it
                 started moving I felt as if I was on a carnival ride. After we
                 landed in Boston our hosts took us to go watch a baseball
                 match and at the end of the game, they bought us Redsoxx
                 sweaters, gloves and hats.

                 After the game we went to watch the Boston marathon
                 and then bowling, were we spent a day having fun with the
                 members of the junior board. One of my highlights was going
                 to Harvard University and going to Bobby Sager’s house.                                                                          I really enjoyed the trip and I have learnt a lot from a lot of
                 Then we went to Las Vegas and my breath was taken away                                                                           people who have made me look at life differently, they also
                 by the beauty that surrounded the place.                                                                                         made me believe that I am capable of achieving anything. The

                 Later that night we went for dinner and we got huge ribs and                                                                     own children.
                 tried a lot of things like fried pickles. During our stay in Las
                 Vegas we participated in the Safelite marathon. The next day                                                                     Sibongile
                 we went to Columbus Ohio where we went to the Safelite
                 headquarters and saw a windshield being fixed.

beyond language. Since the young competitors

                       corruption and state capture scandals                                                                                      collapse. On the contrary, Afrika Tikkun since its

 Emerging Leaders Foundation

It is often a challenge, especially in the African context, to talk about one's
accomplishments without appearing to be too proud or self-centred. But when
the whole continent recognizes your work, remaining silent might be too rude a
response to give.


Emerging Leaders Foundation was feted with the African Impact Award on the
16th of August 2019 at the National Museums of Kenya by the Voice Achievers
Award.


This award is in recognition of our work over the last seven years, during this
time, we have trained well over 20,000 young leaders in Kenya spread over 29
counties.


Leadership is pegged on the ability to influence; individuals, families,
organizations, communities and even nations. Everything, we believe, rises and
falls on leadership. That is why at ELF we are obsessed with adding tools to the
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS045EmergingLeadersFoundation","toolbox of young emerging leaders to prepare them for sustainable development
of their societies.


Our alumni have proceeded to become productive members of society,
championing for communities where people live with dignity and leadership is
values based.


Take a walk from Kilifi County where you will find our alumni involved in their
communities through activities like sports for change. You will find them in
Mombasa advocating for financial integrity in the county. In Makueni and
Murang'a they will be the ones mobilising fellow youth around issues and
promoting entrepreneursh ip for livelihood. They will be running for student
leadership positions in different universities and institutions of learning here in
Nairobi and beyond. In Narok and Migori, our alumni are championing for an end
to early marriage and FGM, and promoting the education girls in those counties.


In short, we have successfully invaded all the spheres of our society with the
contagious flu of values-based leadership which is proactive and transformative.
This award fans to flame our passion for the youth of Africa, besides rubber
stamping our place on the global map as the leading African organization on
matters youth leadership development and mentorship.


The Voice Achievers Award is a project of The Voice magazine and recognizes
Africans and friends of Africa for outstanding achievement on a yearly basis.
Among prominent Africans honoured by The Voice in the past are Dr. Kenneth
Kaunda, former President of Zambia, President Dr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President
of the Republic of Sierra Leone, Mrs. Fatou Bensouda, The Chief Persecutor of the
International Criminal Court (ICC), Ms. Miet Smet - President European
Parliamentarians for Africa, Apostle Hayford lkponmwosa Alike (OFR),
outstanding African diplomats and many more.


Thank you, Voice Magazine, for amplifying our voices and thank you Africa for
noticing our local contributions at a global arena.

LEADERS
ELF is in the business of identifying
polishing and supporting Africa's Young
                                                                     V
leaders. We prepare them to shape the
future of the continent through our three-
step model: Self Discovery, People
Connection, Community Impact.



Discover
Leaders must first discover and know who they are before embarking on making any
change in their communities. We guide participants in reflecting and articulating
narratives from their personal life journeys. Each leader in the program is tutored on
how to use the powerful art of storytelling to share the truths from triumphs and failures
that continue to shape their lives.

""We have to dare to be ourselves, however frightening or strange
that self may prove to be."" -   May Sarton

Connect
Establishing a connection with people is the first step to having influence in many
communities. We impart our young leaders with the fundamental skills for a good first
impression and developing an authentic connection when working with their target
constituency.
""We are all different. Don't judge, understand instead."" - Roy T Bennett

Impact
Leadership is about results. It's about making a real tangible difference in the lives of
communities. ELF works in partnership with organizations to offer internships,
exchange programs and work opportunities for the leaders in the making to start on
their impact journey.

ABOUT CHANGAMKA FELLOWSHIP
In a series of pre-election engagements of young people in Kenya's 2017 elections,
IFES Kenya through its IFES-GAC program proved that beyond developing avenues
and platforms of participation and interest among young people in the electoral, public
and political spaces; there was among other needs the want for structured mentorship
sessions on various topics among them self-development and economic
empowerment and impacting their communities.

It is upon this premise that IFES Kenya under the IFES-GAC program partnered with
Emerging Leaders Foundation (ELF), Emerging Leaders Foundation (ELF) - a
Leadership training, mentorship and coaching platform that concerns itself with
growing the next generation of value-driven and sufficiently tooled leaders for
transformative change in communities throughout the Global South.

ELF got into a contract with IFES Kenya on this program to mentor a group of 40
select young people aged between 18 and 30 years' old who had been part of a bigger
group dubbed the Campus Ambassadors.

 Emerging Leaders Foundation (ELF)

Emerging Leaders Foundation (ELF) is an African youth centered non-profit
organization that provides practical, values-based leadership development,
mentorship, governance and livelihoods training to promising young Africans,
so that they can become positive agents of sustainable social, economic and
political transformation in society. ELF exists to increase the participation of
young men and women in governance and policy processes in order to promote
dignity in society through increased accountability and service delivery on the
part of duty bearers. We believe that when youth are equipped with the relevant
knowledge, skills, and competencies, they begin to participate more strategically
and productively in leadership and governance processes.



OUR STORY
ELF was started in 2012 in Kenya to reach out to young people between 15 - 35
years, to help them discover their purpose, utilize their potential and become the
best they can be in life. In Kenya just like in other African countries, young people
account for more than 50 per cent of the total population.


As an organization, we believe that young people are the best resource that any
nation has to be able to sustain growth and prosperity. At the moment the reality
is that majority of young people in Kenya and Africa at large are in the periphery
of decision making and policy processes.
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS045EmergingLeadersFoundation","WHO WEARE
ELF is a leadership cradle that nurtures young African men and women with the
potential and promise of championing for positive change at the grassroots level.


We provide a platform for young people to reach inside for something bigger to
live for, and to thirst for knowledge and skills necessary to function optimally. We
encourage them to dream of a better world for all humanity starting with the
communities they call home.



OUR TEAM
The ELF core team consists of knowledgeable and experienced professionals
committed to all-rounded development of youth. They bring with them a wealth
of experience in organizational development, self-development, mentorship,
leadership, effective participation in governance, fundraising, grants
management, politics, gender perspectives, advocacy and capacity building.
The combined team expertise includes youth development, program assessment
and implementation, group work, behavior management, coaching, mentorship,
facilitation, curriculum development, leadership development and sustainable
development.

“...I had a great desire to be an agent of

and Martin Luther King Jr.

Their stories compelled me to be at service
to humankind. Before that life at the Univer-

dimmed at a point in my life when in 2009 I
had to drop out of school for 3 years...”

HIGHLIGHTS


  Having successfully done phase one of this project last year which culminated in the
  National Youth and Devolution Symposium in June 2018 which brought together about
  300 youth at the Kenya School of Government to discuss the place of young people in
  the devolution process, at the end of the symposium a position paper was presented to
  government (State department for youth affairs).

  FORD Foundation supported the scaling up of this project to four more counties (Kilifi,
  Makueni, Murang’a and Narok) in addition to the initial four counties (Uasin Gishu,
  Kericho, Migori and Bungoma).
                                                                       Page 1
  We successfully did a round of capacity building sessions from Kilifi to Bungoma form-
  ing
  a team of 15 champions of transparency and accountability in each of the counties.
  We are now in the process of planning for the 2nd Youth and Devolution Symposium
  in May to bring together all the participating counties in this project and invite all the
  other counties to come and learn and share information on how to position youth at the
  heart
  of devolution.

  We will later on have an exchange program between the participating counties to
  enhance learning and sharing and also to build a team of good governance champions
  who are networked across the country.

                                                                                    Page 6

JULIET AWUOR: ELF COHORT 6 MENTEE

    I have learnt to embrace rejection, that when I received an acceptance mail
    from Emerging Leaders Foundation, I decided to make the most of this fellow-
    ship.

    An eighteen-year-old girl goes to the clinic, accompanied by her first boy-
    friend, to treat what seemed like an STI. Nothing could have prepared her
    from the revelation. I tested positive for pregnancy, had an STI and turned out
    to be HIV positive. My dreams of pursuing education went down the drain. I
    remember going to the University of Nairobi to apply for the joint admissions
    board, given that I had scored a B-; and stood a chance of getting into the sys-
    tem. I never followed it through. I had a lot going on.

where they can come and learn and share with one another as they get one-one
coaching from leading figures across the globe. We are talking about our own
“Chatham House” where African dignitaries, academicians and leading schol-

  DEVOLUTION SYMPOSIUM, HELD ON 12TH AND 13th JUNE, 2019, AT AFRICA
  INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY, KAREN , NAIROBI


  A total of 300 youth delegates drawn from all the 47 counties of the Republic of Kenya,
  attended a 2-day meeting, dubbed the ‘2nd National Youth and Devolution Symposium’
  convened by Emerging Leaders Foundation (ELF). The symposium, whose theme was
  ‘Positioning the Youth at the Heart of Devolution’ was a culmination of work that ELF
  has been doing in 8 counties (Kilifi, Makueni, Murangá, Narok, Uasin Gishu, Bungoma,
  Migori and Kericho), working specifically to strengthen the capacity of youth in terms of
  how they engage their respective county governments.


  The over-arching objective of the symposium was for the youth drawn from across the
  country to reflect on the progress made in attaining the youth agenda through devolution,
  discuss the pitfalls and explore other emergent issues and opportunities, going forward.


  Overall, the participants noted that:
1. Kenya has an enabling policy, legal, institutional and constitutional framework that
   provides opportunities for realization and implementation of the youth agenda, in a
   manner that fulfils their aspirations. However, all these opportunities are impeded by
   rampant corruption and wanton theft of public resources in both the county and national
   level.
2. Emerging Leaders Foundation, together with other youth serving organizations in the
   non-state actors’ group, have played a significant role in supporting youth initiatives,

   enabling youth to realize socio-economic and political aspirations.


3. Devolution remains a pivotal platform on which youth can prosecute their agenda in a
   manner that is constructive, progressive and sustainable.

4. Statutory, periodic elections offer an opportunity for youths to access positions of power
   and exert their influence in championing youth related issues, both at the National and
   County Assemblies.

5. The Access to Government Procurement Opportunities (AGPO) program, if implemented
   as it should, is a progressive intervention for socio-economic empowerment of the youth
   in the country.

6. Depression and extreme gambling among the youth are the emerging vices in the country
   that need urgent government action at both national and county level.


   Going forward, the delegates agreed that:


1. Devolution is still a work in progress, with multiple loopholes both in law and
   implementation. Its success is hinged, in part, on robust public participation, especially
   from the youths
2. The National Government’s Big Four Agenda offers a defined avenue through which
   youth can deepen their participation in devolution, especially in view of the ongoing plans
   to align these 4 sectors (manufacturing, job creation, universal health and affordable
   housing) with the developmental plans of the devolved units.


3. Politics and hero-leadership has taken undue status in the country. Political competition
   has taken precedence over development planning.

4. Oversight in the county governments has been marred with multi-layered conflicts of
   interest by players.

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS045EmergingLeadersFoundation","5. Optimal realization of public participation will depend on synergies, which youth must
   forge, at the county level, to consolidate their agenda, expand their platform and amplify
   their voice as a united front.



   Finally, the delegates recommended that:


1. For effective promotion of youth development projects, county governments in
   partnership with all stakeholders should make deliberate efforts to develop youth-centred
   development programmes informed by an all-inclusive consultative process.
2. The Ministry of Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs, through the State Department
   of Youth needs to harness youth-serving efforts at all levels of National and County
   government to leverage on available platforms for young people. This can be achieved
   through an inter-agency for information sharing and programme coordination.
3. All county governments take up open tender systems to weed out institutionalised
   corruption in that sector.


4. There is need for county governments to increase responsiveness to youth issues, not only
   in policy articulation in the CIPDs, but also through budgetary allocations and visible,
   auditable projects.


5. All youth across the country ought to support the government’s renewed war on
   corruption, which has had pervasive effects on youths by curtailing their participation in
   governance and access to government services.


6. All youth ought to embrace a value-driven life especially those in positions of
   responsibility. This is, in many ways, the anchor of good governance.

7. Individuals and institutions working within youth spaces especially at the county level,
   should seek to build networks, eliminate silo mentality and define common issues that
   they can pursue collectively.

       from devolution, a lot more needs to be done in adjusting the current policy, legal,
       regulatory and institutional framework to respond to emerging realities on youth issues.
       The approval of the Draft National Youth Policy needs to be expedited by the Cabinet.


Overall, it is our aspiration that more partners, both state and non-state, will work together, to
continue bringing youth and youth-led organizations, at the center of policy making within their
respective counties.


Ahead of the 3rd Youth and Devolution Symposium in 2019, we expect to see the following,
among other things:
      Increased public awareness of the role of youth in implementation of devolution in
       Kenya. Specifically, deepening their awareness of the opportunity to take part in policy
       and decision-making in their respective counties.
      Constructive engagement and influence of youth in the devolved functions
      Strengthened capacity and role of youth and local organizations in implementation of
       devolution.
      Strengthened accountability mechanisms for youth actors in the devolution space.

Ratification of the Position Paper:
The participants unanimously agreed with the contents of this position paper, and by motion, the
following two delegates ratified it on behalf of the other participants:
   1. Ms. Winnie Mukosi – Delegate, Makueni County
   2. Mr. Ken Ruto – Delegate, Uasin Gishu County

Alumni associations
As a Commonwealth Alumnus, we encourage you to join a local alumni association in your home country, or in the country in which
you are currently living or working.

Our alumni associations are coordinated by alumni volunteers who are responsible for organising a range of local events and
activities which encourage networking and ongoing professional development. In certain countries, alumni associations are
supported by the British Council (on behalf of the CSC), which assists in establishing and strengthening these groups.

All CSC alumni events are advertised on our Calendar. If you do not receive an invite to an event happening near you, please
contact us at alumni@cscuk.org.uk

Each alumni association is different, from the types of events they organise to their membership requirements. A list of current
alumni associations and contact information can be found below.

The CSC is not responsible for the content of external sites or the operation of alumni associations.

Call for volunteers
If your country is not listed below, then an alumni association has not yet been set up. If you are interested in volunteering to
coordinate an association, or organising a local event to re-connect with fellow alumni , please get in touch with us at
alumni@cscuk.org.uk

Development Training Programme 2019-2020
Background


Development Training is a key part of the Commonwealth Scholarship award. The CSC aims to equip
Commonwealth Scholars with the skills to effect real development impact on their return home, as well as
to create a community of motivated Commonwealth Scholars through an extensive programme of training
and networking.


CSC Virtual Engagement Programme


With the unfolding Covid-19 crisis in the UK, the CSC took the decision in mid-March to cancel all planned
face to face events for the rest of the academic year to safeguard the health and wellbeing of our Scholars
and staff involved in delivering these events, and to comply with Government guidance. Since then we
have been looking into alternative ways of ensuring Scholars and alumni can continue to network and
engage with each other through our events and training, and therefore we are pleased to announce the
start of our Virtual Engagement Programme of events, activities and training for 2020.


Our first virtual site visit chats took place in May with Scholars based at Liverpool Hope University,
Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the University of Liverpool.
We have also hosted virtual site visits with Scholars based in Wales, Bath, London and Leeds.


With further virtual site visits planned in June and July, we hope you will be able to join CSC staff and
fellow Scholars at one of these informal meetups soon. Please see the list of proposed virtual site visits
below.

                                       After completing her BSc in Economics and Statistics from Kenyatta University, Kenya, Joan briefly
                                       worked for Kenya Airways before branching to Research and Development and ended up working as a
                                       researcher for World Agroforestry Center-lCRAF in Nairobi. It is at ICRAF where her interest in
                                        sustainable development developed. She now works towards combining business cases, environmental
                                       rationale and social logic to address the selfishness and apathy of the ones responsible of managing

                                             Technology, Ghana. He is currently a doctoral candidate at the Central University of Technology, Free
                                             State. His research is in campus sustainability, specifically the use of solar photovoltaic in promoting
                                             green buildings at universities.

                                             Nutifafa believes that action speaks louder than words, and that what wings are to a bird is what
                                             education is to those who receive it. For this reason, he founded T-Action Global, an organisation
                                             which awards scholarships, promotes third party scholarship opportunities, and provides support and
                                             guidance to scholarship applicants, as a means of giving back to his community.

As the Knowledge Hub Coordinator (Alumni) of the climate change resilience and mitigation hub, Nutifafa hopes to facilitate
discussions and exchange ideas among Commonwealth Scholars to advance action towards addressing the causes and impacts
of climate change.

Nutifafa is a 2011 Shared Scholar from Ghana. He completed an MSc Environmental Management at Liverpool Hope University.

AYLS93_0verview I Commonwealth Scholarship

Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in the
UK
The CSC's evaluation and monitoring (E&M) programme aims to:
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS093_CommonwealthScholarship","   • Monitor the experiences, satisfaction, and performance of Commonwealth Scholars and Fellows
   • Identify and measure the outcomes and impact of Commonwealth Scholarships and Fellowships on
      individuals, institutions, and communities and societies
   • Contribute to the CSC's learning processes and inform strategic and operational decision-making
   • Strengthen accountability and communicate outcomes to award holders, funders, and other
      stakeholders
The E&M programme is coordinated by a team at the CSC Secretariat and overseen by the CSC's Evaluation
and Monitoring Committee.



Approach




The CSC uses a variety of methods to gather evidence relating to the outcomes and impact of its eight
scholarship schemes. In particular, we aim to track individual trajectories to determine personal award
outcomes, as well as exploring the cumulative impact of awards on wider socioeconomic development.


Surveys
Each year we send out surveys to incoming Commonwealth Scholars and Fellows and alumni to gather
information about their pre- and post-scholarship/fellowship careers. From alumni, we collect details on
the knowledge and skills that they gained during their award, and their ability to apply these skills in the
workplace after returning home. We also ask for details of their activities, and the impact they are having in
key development sectors.


We are also interested in the experiences and views of other stakeholders and partners; we survey hosts,
employers, and overseas nominating agencies. We also undertake ad hoc survey exercises.


Findings from these surveys are reported to the CSC's E&M Committee and the wider Commission, and are
also P-Ublished for wider dissemination.




Interviews and focus group discussions

interviews and focus group discussions. These activities enable us to gain an in-depth understanding of the
successes of our alumni and the challenges that they face in their careers, as well as providing a wealth of
rich information about wider outcomes and impact.


As with surveys, the E&M team has also initiated interviews and focus groups with hosts and supervisors, in
order to better understand their experiences of the programme and to document its benefits to UK
universities and host organisations.



Developing new tools and methods
Over the past ten years, the E&M programme has developed and refined its methods, building on an initial
(essential) tracing and survey exercise. We have experimented with counterfactual approaches, aligned
data collection tools across programmes to allow for future comparative review, and developed a new
longitudinal survey methodology. Upcoming priorities include building on existing qualitative work, and
developing new and improved means of publishing and disseminating our findings.



Scholarship evaluation: collaborating with others
The CSC is continually striving to improve its approach to scholarship evaluation. As well as attending
relevant workshops, seminars, and other events within the evaluation and higher education sectors, the
E&M team works closely with external colleagues in the UK and overseas to share experiences and
knowledge wherever possible. In addition to our own P-Ublications, we work with the Association of
Commonwealth Universities to curate the 'Measuring Success?' blog series, featuring contributions from
colleagues throughout the sector discussing their experiences of analysing the outcomes of scholarships
and of evidence-informed policymaking.

BUT WHAT GENERATION DO YOU WANT TO BE?
Imagine the KECTIL Generation ••••


We are youth not defined by the year we were born. We are defined by our focus on a
future that demands our attention. We are the youth leaders of Developing Countries.
Toe:ether as a e:lobal team we are called to chane:e our communities for the better. And
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS136_KectilGeneration","we have the strength to do it.

Positive.

   1. Positivity begins with ourselves. Self-confidence starts by finding our inner strength. This inner
     strength makes us ready to change the world around us.
   2. We train our minds by learning as much as possible about the world we live in. We read and study
     purposefully. We look at all angles and consider all views with respect. We absorb information and
     then check it for accuracy or bias.
   3. We are honest and reliable.
   4. We treat everyone with kindness and compassion, especially when we disagree.
   5. We are positive role models for both the old and the young.
   6. We each contribute our own special skills to the goal and look for others who can contribute as
     well. It is together that we form the necessary whole.
   7. We abide by the Kectil Code to equally respect everyone regardless of nationality, religion, culture,
     ethnicity or gender.
   8. We know we will be successful because we have to be. We will not settle for less.

Change.

   1. We demand good honest government.
   2. We reject and expose corruption. Corruption has devastating effects on Youth and it has to stop.
   3. We, as Males being Promise Leaders and Females also doing their part, will support and encourage
     each other's well-being through respect and encouragement.
   4. We fight for the improvement of our environment, from small tasks such as picking up garbage, to
     living a sustainable lifestyle to tackling large waste projects.
   5. We acknowledge the problem of overpopulation and disproportionate growth in developing
     countries, and we study its projected effects on our future.
   6. We innovate and create using the best of our talents to improve the quality of life.
   7. We strongly reject prejudices and hatred based on nationality, religion, culture, ethnicities, social
     position and gender, which have been imposed on us. We accept everyone and expect the same
     from them.
   8. We reach out to youth in other countries to create the global network for change. We commit to
     forming life-long unbreakable bonds. And we commit our support.

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS136_KectilGeneration","We are adding another 1000 to our previously reached goal of 1000!

In 2019, Kectil launched an initiative called ""1000 Males Campaign"" on its website. We challenged males
to stand up to a large leadership role to protect females in their societies.
We successfully met the goal with 1000 Male Pledges from more than 72 countries in the world! That is a
big milestone for us, and we are so proud to receive messages from Promise Keepers saying how they
have been keeping their promises after pledging a year ago.
We publicly honor those males who participated and acted as they promised! We have set a new goal
where those who have already pledged can promise again while still inviting others to join!

2000 Male Promise Keepers!!

The Malmar Knowles Family Foundation and The Kectil Program are excited to announce that the male
pledges portal is now reopened! In 2019, we successfully reached the goal of attaining 1000 pledges with
the support of 1000 brave males from 72 countries. We have been motivated to take this legacy up a
notch by launching the ""2000 Males Campaign"". Yes, we have decided to double the goal!
With more males involved in protecting females, the communities will indefinitely get better for
everyone. With that belief, we ask men to stand up and act as ""Promise Keepers"" to take care of the girls
and women in their society, to profess their commitment to the females at large, and to protect females
against any forms of violence.
We call for males to take the following pledge:
1. When you see a female you find atractive, you must ask yourself this VERY important question. ""If I am
with this female and she gets pregnant, would I be willing to take care of her and the baby with a full
commitment?"" If the answer is no, then put your hands in your pocket and walk away.
2. I agree not to hit or physically attack a female.
3. I agree to keep my eyes open as a protector to identify situations in which a female is at risk and will
try to take reasonable steps to help if possible.
4. I will encourage other males to take the Kectil Promise Leaders Pledge.
If you have already participated in ""1000 Males Campaign"", we encourage you to continue the pledge at
the website and keep up your mission of protecting females you took up and share the message to other
men.
If you have not, please do now!
One man can't make a change, but together we can definitely bring a better world for our females, girls,
our future daughters and granddaughters.

The Kectil Program


    The lectil Generation
      Positive. Change.
Mission
The Kectil Program was created to identify and nurture highly talented youth in developing countries
who have the potential to make a positive difference in their communities and countries.


Framework

We accomplish our Mission Statement by:
We accomplish our Mission Statement by (i) facilitating innovative leadership training and (ii) providing a
means to allow these highly talented youth become part of a guided network with other similarly
talented and passionate youth in developing countries who will support, nurture, teach and learn from
each other as they mature.
The Kectil Framework embodies both of the goals of the famous African proverb:
   ""Ifyou want to go fast, go alone; ifyou want to go far, go together.""


Kectil Code

The Kectil Code is the framework of the Kectil Program. Each participant is required to comply with
the Kectil Code.

   • Each participant shall be referred to as a Kectil Colleague and shall treat others as Colleagues.
   • Each Kectil Colleague will give equal respect to every other Kectil Colleague regardless of
      nationality, religion, culture or gender.
   • Each Kectil Colleague will discuss ideas and contributions of other Kectil Colleagues with positive,
      collaborative and respectful comments.
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS136_KectilGeneration","     • Each Kectil Colleague will honor the Developing Country Youth Leadership Network by creating
         positive, lasting bonds with other Kectil Colleagues with the intent to stay connected and
         positively support each other toward future leadership that adds value to the local and national
         community.
     • Each Kectil Colleague will carry out all the assignments of the program.
     • Each Kectil Colleague will use best effort to attend each webcast of the program.
     • Kectil Colleagues uphold the honor of the Kectil Program by treating others in his/her community
         with respect and compassion.
     • Kectil Colleagues will not take non-prescribed drugs or misuse alcohol.
     • If selected to attend the Developing Country Youth Leadership Conference in Atlanta, the Kectil
         Colleague will conduct himself/herself in a manner that is a role model for others and will be an
         excellent representative of his/her community.


The Kectil Program

""KECTIL"" is an acronym that refers to the Knowles Educational and Charitable Trust for
International Leadership.
The Kectil Program is based of the following principals:

     • Creating an authentic, collaborative network of high potential youth from developing and least
         developed countries can break down prejudices, lead to cultural, religious and gender
         understanding and give youth the comfort that they are more than just themselves- they are part
         of a mutual youth-based support system with the goal to make a positive difference in their lives,
         their Colleagues' lives and the lives of those in their communities.
     • Identifying, embracing and mentoring high potential youth (17-26) from developing and least
         developed countries can have a dramatic effect on the youths' dreams, service to others and life
         accomplishments.
     • Nothing comes easy and there is ""no free lunch."" The results will not be achieved without hard
         work, dedication and an open mindedness to cultural understanding and compassion.

The Program works to achieve these goals in three parts: a one-year Web-based Program, the
Developing Youth Leadership Conference in Atlanta, United States, and the Alumni Network.
Due to logistics and cost, more applicants can be accepted for the Web-based Program than the
Developing Youth Leadership Conference in Atlanta. If an applicant is accepted for the Web-based
Program but not the Developing Youth Leadership Conference, the applicant can apply the next year to
attend the Conference. All applicants accepted for either (i} the Web-based Program or (ii} the Web-
based Program and the Leadership Conference are encouraged to join and actively participate in the
Alumni Network at the end of the Program.

AYLS136_Developing Countries Youth Leadership
Conference I The Kectil Program_Simplified
SourceURL: httRs://kectil.com/Rrogram/youth-leadershiR-COnference/




Developing Countries Youth Leadership Conference

Atlanta, Georgia

July 19th - July 27th, 2019

The Kectil Program hosted it's second one-week intensive leadership conference in Atlanta, Georgia. The
workshop will take place from July 22nd- July 27th, 2019. The Kectil Program selected thirty-one
participants from 15 developing countries to attend. The countries represented are Colombia, Egypt,
Guyana, India, Israel, Kenya, Lesotho, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saint Lucia, South Africa, Uganda,
Turkmenistan and Vietnam.
The conference held at the Georgia Institute of Technology Campus included intensive leadership
training on various topics moderated by Kectil Program Founder and Executive Director Sherry M.
Knowles. We were thrilled to have Mr. Martin Luther King Ill, Kectil Program Advisory Board Member, and
a Human Rights Advocate and Community Activist joining us during the conference with his daughter
Yolanda King for personal discussions with the youth.
We also had our advisory board member Dr. Alison Montgomery joining us to present a talk on
techniques for raising funds for community efforts and larger scale community projects. Dr. Montgomery
is highly experienced in the area of grants and loans for developing countries. We were also very
honored to be able to have a presentation by Dr. George Luber, a noted environmental
activist who studies the effect of climate on disease demographics. He is the Chief of the Climate and
Heath Program for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (""CDC"") in Atlanta.
We were also pleased to that AT&T, the huge telecommunications and entertainment company, invited
us to tour its AT&T Drive Studio in downtown Atlanta. We received a talk about AT& T's innovative efforts
to use the internet in all aspects of transportation and commerce. In addition, we were also invited to
tour the world headquarters for the business operations of The Coca-Cola Company. We will received
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS136_KectilGeneration","talks from Coca-Cola executives and the youth
were able to have photo opportunities there.
The highlight of the conference however, was the youth participants country presentation. Each
participant gave a one-hour presentation on their country's geography, history, culture, demographics
and the political and social environment. The youth also shared with us what it is like to grow up in their
country, the youth challenges, education, mentoring and how to identify and support transformational
youth leaders from their countries.
A critical aspect of the Conference was to create a youth leadership network of these highly talented
individuals who will form the Kectil Generation. They will support and draw from each other after the
conference and as they mature and take on various roles in their lives. Toward that end the Conference
include activities that are bonding experiences as well as ample time to discuss key topics facing each of
their communities.

The 1st African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) convened from 26th - 27th
October, 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, on the theme “African Youth Responses to Climate
Change and Food Security, Action from the Frontline.” The conference was organized by Africa
Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) in partnership with Africa Climate Policy Center
(ACPC), New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), Pan African Climate Justice
Alliance (PACJA) and Zimbabwe United Nations Association (ZUNA).
100 youths selected across Africa in the conference addressing the thematic strands of Youth in
Agribusiness; Climate Change and Development in Africa; Sustainable Agriculture and Food
Security; Green Economy and Technology Transfer; Climate Justice and Human Rights; and
Climate Change and Disaster risk reduction participated in this first edition of the African Youth
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC). This came at a time when Africa as a continent
continues to bear the biggest brunt of climate change due to low resilience and weak capacities,
with the youth despite their huge numbers and innovativeness among the vulnerable alongside
women. Despite the odds, they have been actively engaged in adaptation and mitigation




                                                                   O
initiatives that improve their communities’ resilience to climate change.
The conference therefore provided a platform for the African youths to interact and share best
practices. Five flagship projects were selected to be used as case studies by African Youths in
starting their own projects depending on transferability. The conference also saw the drafting of




                                                M
African youth position for COP 21 which was handed over to African Group of Negotiators at the
fifth Climate Change and Development in Africa Conference (CCDA V).

(AfriYOCC-2016)

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the environmental challenge of climate
change is already modifying Africa’s economies and livelihoods, health, social structure,
infrastructure and natural systems. Over the years, African youth have proved their potential in
both promoting and implementing climate change adaptation projects in their communities.
Their innovations have continually been adopted in responding to climate change impacts. This
is despite various challenges that include low capacity and education, high rates of poverty and
lack of financial resources. At the same time, African youth have been minimally represented in
the respective country policy processes as well as during the UNFCCC climate change
negotiations. Above 50% of the African population are the youth. This justifies the urgent need
for youth capacity development to respond to climate change and inclusion as key stakeholders
in policy process and negotiations. AYICC aims to spearhead new innovations, look into new
systems of success to share with policy and decision-makers, and generally aim to improve on
the current system which is causing long-term and irreversible degradation to our livelihoods –
as the leading youth organization on climate change in Africa.



                                                                    O
In cognizance of the role and potential of the African youth in climate change mitigation and
adaptation and overall sustainable development trajectory, the second African Youth




                                                 M
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC), shall be held in Nairobi, Kenya on 10th to 13th
October, 2016 as AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its formation in 2006 during the
second Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12. Building on the success of the first

edition of conference, AfriYOCC shall provide an avenue for African youths to showcase their
climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, projects and initiatives. Best practices
arising from the various AYICC country chapters shall be developed to an African youth

meeting will dilate on the current post 2015 development agenda and the role of young
people in championing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in
Africa.

The delegates shall have an opportunity to visit ongoing Climate Change adaptation and
agribusiness projects in Kenya for hands-on skills and knowledge replicable in their countries.
Consequently, it shall boost the skills and capacities of African youths to substantially contribute
to the process leading towards and during COP 22. Through partnership with both
Governmental and Non-governmental agencies, the conference shall not only negotiate for
more youth representation in the respective country policy processes towards the forthcoming
CoPs and country specific policies, but also provide learning and engagement opportunities for
African youths. This will greatly enhance their current capacity and potential to actively
participate in both national and international platforms for policy formulation and implementation.
The conference will also provide a platform to re-assess the current position of our negotiators
and create awareness about the critical role young people should play in shifting agendas in the
forthcoming Conference of Parties in Marrakech come November 2016. While a 4 day gathering

issues affecting their livelihoods.

African youth have for long been side-lined to the periphery of the substantive civic and policy
issues facing the continent. However, the worst affected are the rural based youths and those
residing in farming communities, peri-urban areas and those from conflict and post conflict
countries. This has resulted in youths from these marginalized communities having no
knowledge and information on the basic climate change science and adaptation and mitigation
mechanisms. The good news though is that there is capacity amongst many young people who
are already in the circles of upcoming academia, policy specialists, lawyers, journalists and
scientists’ alike. These capacities need to be strengthened and skills shared amongst the wider
group of young people on the continent so that best practices are disseminated and resources
are expanded.

While it is an undeniable fact that climate change is affecting all regions globally, especially in
developing countries, the adverse effects in the future is likely to increase if the Paris agreement
is not ratified and effectuated by all parties. And even though a deal was achieved during
COP21 in Paris, the impacts of climate change will definitely continue into the future. This
suggests that young people will have to not just understand what climate change is and how it is




                                                                      O
affecting our world, opportunities that exists within, but most importantly, participate actively into
finding amicable solutions. Young people of Africa have therefore considered it an inherent
imperative to contribute to their future by organizing the 2nd African Youth Conference on
Climate Change in October 2016 under the theme, ‘Making Climate Finance work for




                                                  M
African Youth.’


2.1 CONFERENCE STRATEGY




                                                E
The conference program shall be based on exploring mechanisms to finance climate adaptation
and mitigation through Innovations in agriculture, technology and other sectors. It shall be




                                     D
highly interactive with unique workshop-style design that enables participants to develop their
potential through practical experience. Participants will divide to participate in thematic
workshops and come up with an African Youth position paper and concrete activities to be
included in the African Youth Strategy on Climate Change.

The delegates shall be engaged in pre-conference activities that shall include and not limited to,
mapping of youth climate change and/or mitigation projects within the conference key focus
areas for selection as best practice and include in the African youth climate change adaptation
and mitigation best practices database and handbook and aggressively fundraise towards their
participation and a successful workshop. The conference shall critically examine the various
country positions and the overall continents positions of the African Group of Negotiators, their
achievements and potentials towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It shall
examine the youth voices in these positions and further develop African youth position for

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is an umbrella youth network of African
based youth organizations, university groups, rural youth groups, schools, and individuals
working on climate change and sustainable development issues. It aims at developing capacity
and strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent need to take action
against the impacts of climate change for both present and future generations.

The initiative (always referred to as the movement) was conceived in Nairobi Kenya 10 years
ago, during the second Conference of Youth (COY2) preceding the 12th Conference of Parties
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC - COP12). The
main reason for its founding was to ensure the inclusion, and active participation of youths from
the south, and specifically Africa, in the international climate change negotiations. This was
needed as the youth are more than half the African population and are most affected by climate
change impacts. They also got massive potential to support the continent to take action on
global warming.

During its formation, it comprised of 8 country chapters and current has grown to 45 country
chapters with over 20,000 members across Africa and the Diaspora. This initiative has provided




                                                                  O
a platform for knowledge, ideas and experiences sharing. It is also an avenue for development
of skills and strategies on youth action on climate change mitigation and adaptation in the
African continent. AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a
platform for them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the




                                               M
UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others.

Since its inception, we have worked in partnership with international youth movements and have




                                             E
played a great role in the establishment of the International Youth Climate Movement whose
youth member organizations are now officially acknowledged by the UNFCCC as the YOUNGO
(Youth NGOs involved in the climate change negotiations process). Since COY2 in Nairobi, it




                                   D
has had youth delegates’ representation in all COP meetings.

In addition to the above, we have had landmark successes that include:
     A reach out programme for a children’s home (Watoto Wema in Ruai) and School
        climate change education program run in selected schools in Kenya.
     Leadership and mentorship programmes especially on volunteerism.
     Community development projects particularly on clean energy (energy saving stoves for
        rural folks)
     Capacity development of youth on agribusiness
     Advocacy campaigns e.g. lobbied for lanes to be set aside along the major highways for
        non-motorised transport especially for cyclists.
     Policy engagements i.e. contributing to the climate change bill 2012,as stakeholders
     Youth Caravan from Kenya to Durban during COP 17

Our charter (Charter of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change) can be found on
www.ayicc.net.
Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any
financial assistance, the greatest resource being the time and skills that the leadership
committee and members contribute. However, in order to scale up our actions and make AYICC
vision a reality, there is need for more human and financial resources.

Founding Opportunities


AYICC Founding Opportunities

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the
environmental challenge of climate change will ultimately modify Africa's economies and livelihoods, health, social structure, infrastructure and natural
systems. To date little has been done to empower, capacitate and mobilise youth, particularly in Africa to address global environmental challenges such as
climate change. facebook d o w n ~ To remedy this, an initial step has been the formation of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC).

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change was formed partially in response to the poor representation of young Africans at the International Youth
Summit on Climate Change (November 24-28, 2005), which was held in conjunction with the United Nation's Climate Change Conference (November 28-
December 10, 2005) in Montreal , Canada. The overall mission of AYICC is to ensure that African youth are equipped toparticipate in future UNFCCC
meetings and other global initiatives for sustainable solutions to environmental degradation and climate change.

In order to ensure a strong youth presence in climate change dialogue and fora, there is a need for AYICC to ensure youth representation from various parts
of Africa. This will enable Africa's youth to engage with the global youth movement, governments and NGO's in a more coordinated and sustained manner.
The long term goal is to ensure sustainable and systematic global youth action, with special emphasis on African youth on the issue of climate change.

Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any financial assistance. The planning committee members have
volunteered their time and their contributions. However, in order to make this vision a reality we need to become a financially viable organisation. For this
reason, we would like to request your financial assistance in getting this vision off the ground.•

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE OPENING FORUM OF THE SEVENTH AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FORUM, 12TH OCTOBER

2010: Ms. Esther Agbarakwe, Nigeria




The Chair,

Climate Change poses significant challenges to future generations. As youth we have a stake in this future; it is our future.




                                                                                                                 O
As the 7th African Development Forum, we have indeed come of age, we are no longer in our childhood stages of determining sustainable development - the
time of maturity has arrived. This year is marked as the International Year of Youth and now, more than ever before, the youth are taking a stand. More than
anyone else, we, the Youth, face unprecedented challenges as a result of global climate change. We also share the responsibility of addressing ii. As a group,
we are key moral stakeholders in the international processes treating the most important challenge of our generation. As it is our future, we will be
disproportionately affected by the catastrophic impacts of climate change.

Advocacy and Behavior Change: II is critical for present and future leaders to collaborate on finding solutions. The need for cultural transformation in our time




                                                                              M
is stronger than ever. This transformation - that enables us to shift towards a more sustainable world - should be an organic process, guided by principles of
compassion, integrity and justice. We need to pragmatically rethink our behavioral patterns, to enable a paradigm shift that is based on an ongoing process of
action, reflection and meaningful participation. Awareness, education and empowerment are fundamental prerequisites to enabling this process, and the youth
are energetic and passionate about holding governments and all relevant stakeholders involved accountable for their actions. We are equal partners in this
process and commit ourselves fully to achieving the objectives as decided by this Forum.




                                                                            E
Contrary to what is believed; young people play a dynamic role in framing and implementing policies. So their role goes beyond advocacy. From an advocacy
perspective, young people are involved in songs and stories which spread awareness in local languages. Of course we understand the importance and
relevance of this because 70% of Africa is based in rural areas and the term Climate Change is foreign, Young people are finding ways of using words in local
languages to translate the message across.




                                                           D
It is time to shift the balance of decision-making towards the generation that will have to manage this unwanted inheritance, to make political and economic
decisions that can span a generation, and to enable real inter-generational and inter-cultural dialogue about climate change to be realized in institutions where
the youth generation can learn.

However at the same time a range of social learning and marketing approaches need to be developed to address the gap between classroom education styles
and education that stimulates real action. This gap prevents the cultural shift from token awareness to personal action and reaction.

Education: In relation to climate change, African Governments should begin at inception to mainstream youth voices and perceptions. This is particularly
important because climate change projections indicate that effects will begin to be most felt in the next 20-30 years - young people should begin to be part of
the solution so that they will be able to cope when disaster calls. Involving them in this programme will ensure that those who will be affected will have direct
knowledge of the challenges and strategies for coping as well as the ability to mobilize communities to respond to and prepare for the impact of climate change
and natural disasters.

Governments must give credence to the higher learning education system in Africa in particular the increased accent on improvement of research and
innovation on climate change specifically highlighting on policy and reform, the programmes, pedagogy and teaching tools. This will enhance an equipped pool
of intellectual capital among the young people on climate change issues who will replicate this to the various organizations and networks that they are part of.

Al government level, during the last Conference of the Parties (COP), ii was pleasing to see that many African delegations included youth and gave them a role
to play. Furthermore, many youth who were involved in COP 15 deliberations have been interacting with their various governments and engaging in processes
and procedures that are related to Climate change policy. There is an understanding that more needs to be done, and at this forum, I urge you to engage young
people who knock on your doors asking to be involved.

Youth and youth based NGOs play a major role either in strengthening local capacity to cope or by supporting local action. Already, groups such as the Nigerian
Youth Coalition and the African youth Climate Initiative-Kenya have established school climate clubs, which are creative ways to engage young people; these
initiatives should be mainstreamed into education systems. Young people in this governance process are important because successful adaptation requires a
host of innovative measures developed with vulnerable communities to improve their present and future livelihoods. Young people are vibrant and are able to
access places that many governmental institutions fail to access. As the majority of the population and Africa's future, it is important to include them in this
impending crisis that is Climate Change.

Already, this conference calls for integrated approaches to enable African countries to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change. There is a dire need
to have a clearer understanding of the potential calamities that climate change can bring and to start the discourse on how best to stave off the worst impacts.
There is already an understanding that

Climate Change is not a localized problem but transcends national borders, hence the need for co-operation of Intergovernmental agencies but also to include
those young and vulnerable people.

Conclusion :
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS143_AfricanYouthCouncilonClimateChange","No longer can climate change be seen as merely an environmental problem or an energy challenge. It is a combination of both, which needs the involvement of
young people to preserve the environment and enter into green energy careers.

It's important for all of us to recognize that sustainable development isn't just a catch phrase - people all over the continent are taking it into their own hands. A
couple days ago over 300 community events took place in nearly every country on the continent of Africa, and more than 7000 globally as part of the Global
Work Party on 10/10/10.

Everywhere in the wortd, people planted trees, cultivated community gardens, installed solar panels, made buildings more efficient and implemented thousands
of other grassroots solutions to the climate crisis. We got to work everywhere in the world, but we need you, leaders, to get to work, too.

Thank you and God bless

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS143_AfricanYouthCouncilonClimateChange","The 25th session of the Conference Parties (COP25) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held from the 2 -13
December bringing together nearly 27000 people to the Spanish capital. COP25
provided parties with the opportunity to finalize the ""rulebook"" of the Paris
Agreement - the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020.


In the spirit of the convention on climate change young people continue to enjoy




                                                                          O
various spaces during COP mainly through YOU NGO; the official youth
constituency to the UNFCCC. Article 6 ofthe Convention and Article 12 of the
Paris Agreement referred to as Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) encourage
the empowerment of every member of the society to take climate actions and
therefore young people who are most vulnerable to the climate crisis are




                                             M
increasingly becoming the centre of discussion.


The world today is home to the largest generation of young people in history and
their energy, creativity, and innovation, when harnessed properly, will accelerate




                                           E
sustainable solutions to the global crisis. Youth have a pivotal role to play in the
implementation of ACE which consists of six elements namely: education,
training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and
international cooperation.




                             D
At COP25, the Intergenerational Inquiry which is a highlight event of Young and
Future Generations Day and like every year provided a platform for youth and
decision-makers to discuss how young people can enhance the implementation
of the Paris Agreement. This platform was attended by the Executive Secretary of
the UNFCCC and provided an opportunity for young people to share the
outcome on the Conference of Youth (COY 15) to the secretariat.


The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) has continued to
empower and mobilize young people at COP through our side events and
exhibitions. Through an exhibition at COP 25, AYICC was able to showcase the
actions and contributions of African youth in the fight against climate change.
Such actions include ecological restorations, renewable energy promotion, and
local conference of youth hosted by our national chapters.


AYICC's greatest concern however, is with regards to the low representation of
African youth at the UNFCCC sessions. There are many contributing factors which
includes lack of funding, inability to assess accreditations and visas. As the first
step in addressing this, we will continue to encourage African countries to make
conscious efforts to include youth delegates in their official delegations for COPs.
We also call on development partners and stakeholders who are interested in
youth development to reach out with their support to AYICC to enhance African
youth participation in this important global process.

Climate Change


• Campaigns and Advocacy
 The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is widely known for our
 incessant campaigns and research-based advocacy on environmental and
 climate change topics. Since 2006 AYICC has been consistent with its
 campaigns impressing on African governments and international community
 alike to deliver on their commitment under the United Nations Framework
 Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) .



• Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)
 Climate change education, training, and awareness creation have been the
 central focus of AYICC targeting youth and vulnerable communities. We do
 this through workshops, conferences, and webinars leveraging on our robust
 online presence. Through our Flagship program; the African Youth Conference
 on Climate Change (AFRIYOCC) we are able to provide a platform for




                                                                     O
 exchange of ideas and sharing of knowledge and best practices among young
 African thereby feeding into article 6 of the climate change convention and
 article 12 of the Paris Agreement.



• Tree planting and Ecological restoration



                                         M
 Trees contribute to their environment by providing oxygen, improving air
 quality, climate amelioration, conserving water, preserving soil, and




                                       E
 supporting wildlife. Beyond the campaigns and advocacies, our member
 organizations embark on tree planting and reforestation activities including
 mangrove restoration along the coast.




                         D
• Renewable energy promotion
 With the increasing demand for energy for industrial and economic
 development, AYICC member organizations in different countries are
 promoting renewable energy access to isolated off-grid communities. AYICC
 believes that Youth-led renewable energy enterprises are a viable means of
 achieving sustainable development, as they promote technologies that are
 less harmful to the global environs while at the same time providing
 sustainable income-generating opportunities for youth .



• Youth in Agribusiness
 AYICC sees agriculture as an essential driver of economic development and an
 area of great opportunity for young people in Africa. The challenge, however,
 is that the growing youth population does not see agriculture as a profitable
 opportunity due to their lack of insight into the opportunities that exist within
 the agriculture value chain. Through our member organizations who are youth
 farmers themselves, AYICC has adopted various strategies including outreach
 to schools and communities, exhibitions and youth agricultural festivals as
 well as institution of award schemes for best youth farmers as a way to raise
 interest and awareness on the opportunities that exist within this sector.



• Recycling

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS143_AfricanYouthCouncilonClimateChange","                            Over recent years, the world has witnessed an increasing level of waste
                            products as a by-product of the increasing level of population, affluence, and
                            technological advancement in a given environment or society. In Africa we
                            have witnessed increasing level of pollution from plastic, car tires, bottles
                            among others and this has generated innovative thinking among young
                            people to provide a sustainable solution. Over the years, AYICC members have
                            redefined waste as a resource for sustainable development and through
                            various recycling initiatives, they are bringing life into materials that otherwise
                            could have been a nuisance to the environment.

About Our Campus
The ALA Campus is a beautiful space on the outskirts of Johannesburg.
Since taking occupation 10 years ago and with the generous support of our
donors purchasing the property, we've been investing heavily. We engaged
with a design team with the aim of designing a residential space to house
students and faculty as well as a Library for the Future of Africa.
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS001_ALA","We now have a living document called the ALA's Campus Master Plan,
which is a process and framework for what ALA will be doing with our
learning space over the next 20 years and beyond.

In 2015, we broke ground on the first big project- The newly constructed
residential wings include that form part of the new Nelson Mandela
Residence with 48 Student dorm room, 4 Faculty family home, 10 Faculty
apartments, 2 Large courtyards, 2 Laundry facilities, 4 Shared lounges and
2 Sick bays!

In 2016 we began building The Pardee Learning Commons, the second
construction project on campus, which will redesign and redefine our
learning spaces, positioning ALA as a model for 21st century teaching and
learning.

We have built an online coffee table book that tracks the story and progress
as we build our campus master plan. We highly recommend you visit it,
particularly the timeline and projects sections.



   Below is the virtual tour of our latest campus project the Fred Pardee
                             Learning Commons.

  Home > Apply to ALA > Fees & Financial Assistance




  Fees & Financial
  Assistance
  ALA is one of the most prestigious education institutions in the world, with a
  unique financial model designed to enable us to identify, develop and connect
  Africa's future leaders. Everyone who applies and is then admitted to ALA,
  regardless of financial background or nationality, is eligible to receive significant
  financial assistance* in the form of scholarships and loans towards studying at
  ALA and accessing membership to our lifelong network. The cost of tuition at
  ALA is USD $30,900 per year.

  At ALA, the value of financial awards is determined after admissions decisions
  have been made. Fees charged to a given student will be based on a family's
  financial means. We expect that every family will stretch themselves to finance
  the ALA education, just as we ask ALA's network of supporters from around the
  world to stretch themselves to ensure that every admitted student is able to
  attend. Students from more financially disadvantaged backgrounds receive more
  significant financial assistance from ALA, and families with more resources are
  expected to contribute more to their child's education at ALA.

  Every student will sign the ALA Social Contract - a commitment to contribute to
  peace and prosperity on the continent for at least 10 years in return for the
  financial assistance provided by our community.

Since inception, ALA and our donors have
contributed nearly $50 Million.
The all-inclusive cost of $30,900 per annum to attend ALA includes:

   • All-inclusive for fees for a full year covering tuition, accommodation, sports,
     activities, meals and uniforms.
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS001_ALA","      • Full access to AL.N.s campus facilities including entertainment areas, sports
         fields, high-speed fibre internet, biometric security control.
      • There is proactive health and wellness care, including private medical
         insurance for every student.
      • The Explore Johannesburg program, which gets students out and about in
         our world-class African city, attending cultural and entertainment events.
      • Access to our exclusive and globally renowned University Guidance and
         ""next steps"" team, who will advise ALA families on tertiary study, gap year
         and other options.
      • Exclusive access to the Africa Careers Network, a team at ALA dedicated
         to finding and securing employment for ALA graduates across the continent
         with top employers.

  All financial assistance awards are determined after an in-depth financial needs
  assessment, and require the commitment to the Social Contract. If a student
  breaks their commitment to the social contract, their scholarship will convert into
  an interest bearing loan, such that they create an ALA experience for another
  future African leader.

Executive
Seminars
Executive Seminars
are more intimate
workshops with
smaller groups of
interested students,
covering specialized
subjects. Seminars
are held
approximately once
every two weeks.
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS001_ALA","Topics of Executive
Seminars in the past
have included a
working session on
proposals to the
Global Fund for HIV
run by former
chairperson of the
Global Fund, Wilfred
Griekspoor, a
session on
the Power of
Storytelling, an all-
women panel
on Women in
Entertainment and
Media.

ALA actively
connects its young
leaders to global
platforms such as
the Aspen Institute,
the World Economic
Forum, the Clinton
Global Initiative and
TED, where our
young leaders share
their ideas for
Africa's
transformation and
foster the
connections that will
enable them to
translate vision to
action. Each year,
over 100 students
get to attend
conferences with
renowned leaders in
Africa and around
the world.

Academy seeks to
transform Africa by
developing a
powerful network of
over 6,000 leaders
who will work
together to address
Africa's greatest
challenges, achieve
extraordinary social
impact, and
accelerate the
continent's growth
trajectory.
Africa's greatest
need is ethical and
entrepreneurial
leadership. Too
often, we only invest
in addressing the
symptoms of poor
leadership in Africa:
we give blankets,
food, and medicine
to those impacted
by war, poverty, and
famine. But these
efforts will never
stop unless we
develop leaders who
prevent wars,
entrepreneurs who
create jobs, and
innovators that
develop lasting

solutions to the root
causes of Africa's
problems. We aim to
develop the future
Nelson Mandela, the
next Wangari
Maathai, and the
African Bill Gates.

     INTRODUCTION TO THE ALA SOCIAL CONTRACT AND FORGIVABLE LOAN

Introduction
The following memo is a guide to your financial assistance award. After reading this memo you should have clarity
and understanding of:

    1.   Our Guiding Principles
    2.   What the ALA Social Contract is
    3.   What your ALA tuition fees entail
    4.   What the terms of the financial assistance agreement mean
    5.   What the deferment process entails
    6.   Who to contact should you have comments or queries


1. Our Guiding Principles

At African Leadership Academy, we believe that financial circumstances should not impede a student from reaching
their full potential, and should not rob Africa of its most promising talent. When we admitted you to ALA, we made
a statement about our belief in your potential to transform the continent, and about our commitment to empower
you on your leadership journey.

If you and your family cannot afford or independently finance your education at ALA, we have, through the
generosity of our donors, made institutional loans available to you. Our loans, unlike almost any other loan you may
seek, are forgivable if you meet the terms of your financial assistance agreement, because our loans are a social
contract between you and the entire ALA community.

2. The ALA Social Contract

A social contract is an agreement for mutual benefit between an individual or group and the government, an
organisation or community as a whole. At ALA, donors, parents, students, alumni, and staffulty come together to
support ALA’s mission to promote lasting peace and shared prosperity on the African continent. We do this by
identifying, developing, and connecting the next generation of African leaders. Under ALA’s model, students’
financial circumstances are not considered during the admissions process (we have “need-blind admissions”), and all
admitted students can receive need-based financial assistance in the form of a forgivable loan to ensure they can
attend the Academy.

The ALA forgivable loan agreement is a social contract entered into between the incoming student and the entire
ALA community. The members of our community have come, and continue to come together, in order to develop
leaders for the continent. Therefore, the loan is forgiven for the alumni that return to have impact on the continent
for at least 10 years after their 25th birthday (or from the moment they complete their undergraduate degree,
whichever comes first).

ALA is not expecting you to fulfil your part of the social contract on your own. We have made a lifelong
commitment to the development of your career, and have established the Department of Lifelong Engagement to
assist you in your career development.

3. What Your Tuition Fees Entail

structure provided by ALA Finance. If you choose to accept our financial assistance award, ALA will cover the
difference between your expected student contribution and ALA’s full tuition through a financial assistance award.
Our financial assistance award is an option for you, not an obligation. You must let us know if you choose to accept
it, or if you will find other means to cover the gap between your expected student contribution and ALA’s full
tuition.

If you choose to accept ALA’s financial assistance please read below to understand the terms of your Financial
Assistance Agreement.

Please note that financial assistance is optional, therefore this section may not be applicable to all students

4. Understanding Key Terms in Your Financial Assistance Award Agreement

During the Admissions process of enrolment at ALA, you will sign two key documents, namely:

     1. The ALA Enrolment Contract; and
     2. ALA Financial Assistance Award Agreement (Optional)


The ALA Financial Assistance Award Agreement contains key terms which require thorough understanding. Below
is a summary of the key terms and their interpretations:

Forgivable Loan

A forgivable loan is a form of a loan in which its entirety, or a portion of it, can be forgiven by the lender when
certain conditions are met. However, if the conditions are not met, the loan has to be repaid, usually with interest.
ALA’s financial assistance is structured this way to honour the promise under which ALA’s past and present donors
chose to support ALA, namely, to develop leaders who will develop the African continent. The interpretation of this
statement has been, and continues to be, that our young leaders will have the most impact on the continent by being
present on the continent. Therefore, the loan is forgivable on condition of your physical return and residence on the
continent.


3.2 Establish residence and employment in Africa for a period of 10 years

The interpretation of ‘employment’ has been broadened to mean ‘reside in Africa’. This means that as long as you
are physically present on the African continent, ALA will assume your residence to also mean you are positively
contributing economically and socially to the African continent. Entrepreneurial ventures, part-time or full-time
employment, pursuing any post-graduate education – (such as graduate school, a second degree, a PhD, etc.) will
also count to fulfil the terms of your contract. Your mere presence in Africa is enough. Please note that the
abovementioned examples are not exhaustive.

You are required to be physically present on the African continent for a minimum of 10 years to qualify for the full
loan forgiveness. Every year you spend on the African continent after your undergraduate degree counts toward
forgiveness. 1/10th of your loan will be forgiven every year you spend on the African continent, meaning that by the
end of the 10th year, your loan will be fully forgiven.

Please note that as a general rule, any time spent on the African continent prior to age 25 or before completing your
undergraduate degree will not count towards forgiveness. Gap years, starting a venture before (or instead of going
to) college, complete internships, etc., may be considered towards your Return To Africa commitment on a case-by-
case basis.

3.3 Principal amount and accrued interest

Principal Amount: The original loan amount borrowed.

Accrued Interest: The growing amount charged by the lender (ALA) to a borrower (the student) for the cost of
borrowing.



3.4 [Interest is] compounded annually

Compounded interest arises when interest is added to the principal amount of a loan, so that the interest that has
been added to the loan also accrues interest. In a way, compounded interest can be thought of as “interest on
interest,” and can be contrasted with simple interest, which is interest calculated only on the principal loan amount.

Your financial assistance loan begins accruing interest immediately after your studies at ALA begin and continues to
do so until the loan is forgiven or paid in full. The interest rate for your loan is set at 18% per year.


5. Applying for Deferment

Should you wish to postpone your return to the African continent after your 25th birthday, you have the option of
deferment available to you. A deferment allows you to choose to postpone repayment on your loan for a specified
period for residency reasons.
You may choose deferment in the following instances:
     Further education
     Job/Research opportunities which are unavailable or rare on the African continent
     Job/Research opportunities which will uniquely prepare you for your career on the African continent
     Job/Research opportunities whose impact has a strong and direct link to the development of the African
        continent
     Unforeseen circumstances such as: unemployment on the African continent, personal and/or extenuating
        circumstances

Please note: the abovementioned examples are not exhaustive. Deferment will be granted on a case by case basis.

The interest on the loan will continue to accrue during the deferment period. You must apply for deferment if you
are planning to reside out of Africa (for any reason) after your 25th birthday. To apply for deferment, you will need
to submit a deferment application form, motivational letter and additional documentation (where required) to
studentloans@africanleadershipacademy.org. A panel will then review your application, and provide your results
within 3 weeks.

 6. Accessing Your Loan Details
The ALA Finance Office will inform you about your loan details via annual statements. Alternatively, you may
contact the ALA Finance Office via email at studentloans@africanleadershipacademy.org for any loan-related
queries you may have.

 Our Alumni Network has now grown to over 2,500 members across South

exciting,"" says Luzuko. ""Especially in 2019 with so many great memories, such
as the Annual Business Summit that had two winners from Cape Town.""

The growth of the Network in Cape Town hasn't been easy, particularly given
their spatial distance from the Alumni headquarters in Johannesburg.
However, the members remained focused and committed and together with
support from colleagues such as Nehwoh Belinda and Warren Radebe, they
were able to create and sustain a vibrant and engaging Alumni community.
Luzuko is particularly grateful for the comradery on the annual Alumni Day,
where all members get an opportunity to network and catch up.

The Young Urban Men and Women programmes remain a favourite as it
provides a safe space for both genders to engage on issues relating to, among
other things, youth sexual and reproductive health. This year, members faced
an unexpected challenge as a result of Covid-19, but are continuing to give
back to the community, help others to stay safe and engage as a network.

an opportunity to gain experience in working with young people.

With Covid-19 affecting my community, I had to change my plans and adjust to
new expenses like higher data usage to do my school work. This sometimes
limits me. Thanks to the YES4YOUTH modules about approaching new
challenges, I have learned a lot about myself - such as what I am capable of,
the importance of saving money and how to spend it wisely.""

  A SUCCESSFUL BERTIE LUBNER LEGACY WEEK

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS004_AfrikaTikkun","The Bertie Lubner Legacy Week continues to inspire young people to follow in the
footsteps of this philanthropic giant, whose legacy still echoes in our hearts. Once
again, the Alumni Network organized vibrant and educational events at all our
centres.

We had over 100 volunteers eager to give their time to local organizations and
schools participating in the Legacy Week. Among these were Childline, Autism
South Africa and lthlokomeleng Old Age Home.

As is the custom, the week kicked off with the launch of the Legacy Museums,
curated exhibitions of the life and times of Bertie Lubner. This served as an
important reminder of the difficult social context within which Bertie Lubner
sought to make change. It's no wonder his incredible achievements continue to
motivate our young people. This year, our members got busy with community
service, painting, cleaning the centres and preparing food for our elderly.

The entire week was an unforgettable movement, providing an opportunity for our
members to give back in the spirit of responsible kindness.

HISTORY OF AFRIKA
TIKKUN
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS004_AfrikaTikkun","We were founded in 1994 by the late Chief Rabbi Cyril Harris and
Philanthropist/Businessman Dr Bertie Lubner. Initially, the day to day
needs of children was a priority but soon after, the organisation
evolved into one focused on overall development. Renamed
MaAfrika Tikkun and later Afrika Tikkun, our approach was refined
and reformulated into the Cradle to Career 360° model. This Model is
aimed at providing education, health and social services to young
people and their families through centres of excellence in South
African townships. Our main goal is to create a sustainable future for
the youth of South Africa and the credibility of this cause won the
support of the organisations Patron-in-Chief in memoriam, Nelson
Mandela. Since then, we have built 4 centres of excellence across
Gauteng and 1 in the Western Cape.

The primary objective of Afrika Tikkun is to provide holistic development i1
disadvantaged communities. We aim to empower young people by affording then
the opportunity to receive gainful education, good health care, nutrition ani
support for their families. In doing so, we equalise the playing field for unprivilegec
young people so that they have the same employment opportunities that privilege<
youth have. We offer a number of programmes that ensure an all rounded perso1
as the outcome. Our 360 degree Model of care consists of three programmei
namely: Early Childhood Development, Child and Youth Development, and Caree
Development. Additionally, we have programmes which support our 360 degre1
Model, namely: Family Support Services, Primary Health Care, The Empowermen
Programme, and Nutrition and Food Security Programme.

                     Over the last 25 years, Afrika Tikkun’s vision has been to enable the economic
                     empowerment of South African young people by tackling the socio-economic drivers
                     that make it difficult for them to break away from the cycle of poverty.

                     We aim to reduce youth unemployment by empowering                                                                                As we celebrate our 25th anniversary, it is an opportunity
                     young people, in the context of family, through the                                                                              to reflect on how far we have come: from offering basic
                     implementation of programmes that support education,                                                                             assistance to victims of floods, fire, hunger, and disease in
                     personal development, career development, nutrition,                                                                             1994, to a full Cradle to Career 360º model and programmes
                     health, skills development, and ultimately work placement of                                                                     impacting an average of 12 000 young lives per annum. Over
                     identified young individuals. This approach is what we have                                                                      the last 25 years we have experienced incredible growth and

                  of executives that I have ever had the privilege of working
                  with. Their commitment, late nights and long hours
                  (including over weekends), reflects a passion for excellence
                  that is noteworthy. My team have learnt to complement
                  one another and take initiative, displaying a drive that most
                  CEO’s can only dream of. It has been my honour to lead a
                  team dedicated to responsible kindness expressed in their

                                                                                   Although government has taken steps to make education

                                                                                   accessible in South Africa, over 55% of the unemployed are

                   The primary objective of Afrika Tikkun is therefore to reduce youth unemployment and child poverty in South
                   Africa by tackling the socio-economic drivers that make it difficult for young people to access the economy as
                   productive citizens.

                   through every stage of development until they emerge as a
                   young educated, value-based, career-driven and employable
                   young adult capable of accessing the economy in real time
                   (our Cradle to Career 360º model). We support them further
                   through our specialised/vocational skills development and
                   career placement programmes with the ultimate objective
                   of actively progressing them into employment or self-

                                                          OUR MODEL AND PROGRAMMES
                 Our Cradle to Career 360º model sets the foundation for all our core programmes and is our commitment to supporting young
                 people from infancy into adulthood and ultimately employment, so that they become economically empowered.

                 The model allows us to provide comprehensive development interventions for our young people, their families and the community
                 at large. In order to provide services and interventions that support young people from cradle to career, our programmes, focus
                 on the specific developmental and age-appropriate needs of young people aged 2-29 years. These services are divided into core
                 and support programmes namely:

                              SINDI SHINES WITH TLC
                 Sindi is 5 years old and lives with her mother and 3 siblings
                 near the Mfuleni centre. She was diagnosed with a lung
                 condition that causes her to use a breathing aid 24/7. When
                 Sindi joined our ECD programme, Empowerment case
                 administrators encouraged the family to join the support
                 group for parents of children with disabilities.




                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       29
                 Sindi’s first months in the programme were tough as she
                 was overly hyperactive and disrupted the class often. Her
                 hyperactivity meant that her breathing aid needed to be
                 cleaned continuously.

                 Her teachers encouraged her to focus her energy on
                 creative art, painting and puzzles. With the aid of Lego
                 Blocks and daily reading, they slowly began to develop
                 her cognitive skills. Additionally, Sindi’s breathing aid was
                 cleaned regularly to improve her lung condition.

                 Through the combined efforts of the ECD teachers,
                 Empowerment case workers and Primary Health Care
                 workers, Sindi has been doing well in her daily activities                                                                       After months of continuous support and
                 and has not had any issues regarding breathing.

                      whomever I wanted to be, but it won’t be easy.

                      In 2011, I passed matric with a bachelor’s, which made my
                      mother proud. I had never seen my family so happy, maybe
                      it’s because I’m the eldest of my siblings. The following three
                      years I was in and out of jobs, which was extremely frustrating.
                      I knew the solution was to enrol for a course that would
                      help me develop myself. I attended college thinking I was
                      on the right track but I became friends with people who had
                      a negative impact on my life. I stopped attending classes and

                      Lulama*, a 15-year-old girl was born HIV-positive. Her younger brother, Sipho* is
                      9 years old and they both attend primary school. Three years ago, Lulama’s HIV-
                      positive mother fell ill. She was in and out of hospital before she finally passed away.
                      The children were left without a caregiver. During that time, Lulama stopped taking
                      her medication and was admitted to hospital. She lost a lot of weight and her diet
                      was very poor, affecting her attendance and performance at school. The children
                      were referred to Afrika Tikkun.

                      Through Afrika Tikkun’s intervention, the children’s maternal uncle decided to
                      take them in. Afrika Tikkun equipped the uncle and his wife with parenting skills,

                      knowing that they had to take care of two children of their own. “We also supported
                      the family with food parcels and other donations. We made sure Lulama was taking
                      her treatment. We also taught the aunt how to care for a child with HIV”.

                      Lulama attends Afrika Tikkun every day – where she receives a healthy meal and
                      plenty of emotional and academic support. In recognition of how much she has
                      progressed and matured, she was selected to attend a leadership camp.

                      “I learnt a lot from that experience. I really appreciate what Afrika Tikkun has done for my family and me”,
                      she says. She is now taking her medication and is on a healthy diet. She is a healthy and happy child. Her
                      class teacher also reports that she is doing well at school.

                      OF GERMANY
                      I thought I was dreaming and never took it seriously until I
                      saw myself at the airport saying goodbye to my family and
                      friends.

                        Here it comes, a scary moment, the dream and all the
50




                      happiness flashes away and is replaced by fear of the
                      unknown. I got on the plane, and realised there was nothing
                      to be afraid of. We arrived in Dusseldorf and met two
                      fantastic mothers who took us for a tour.

                      There were many beautiful places we visited. I could spend
                      the whole day sharing how fun it was.

                      Everyone I met there was great, generous and welcoming.
                      This experience has really changed my life for the better, I
                      saw that the world is big enough for me to reach my dreams
                      and dream beyond Diepsloot.

                      I would like to thank all the people who have contributed to
                      our visit. I am grateful for their time, financial - and any other
                      support.

                 My name is Sibongile, and I was fortunate enough to go to
                 the USA on the 3rd – 30th of April. The first day of traveling
                 was overwhelming, it was my first time being at the airport
                 and my very first time seeing a plane. That day Sipho took
                 us to Mug n’ Bean before our flight, which was also my first

                 the plane my heart thumped with excitement, and when it
                 started moving I felt as if I was on a carnival ride. After we
                 landed in Boston our hosts took us to go watch a baseball
                 match and at the end of the game, they bought us Redsoxx
                 sweaters, gloves and hats.

                 After the game we went to watch the Boston marathon
                 and then bowling, were we spent a day having fun with the
                 members of the junior board. One of my highlights was going
                 to Harvard University and going to Bobby Sager’s house.                                                                          I really enjoyed the trip and I have learnt a lot from a lot of

                 tried a lot of things like fried pickles. During our stay in Las
                 Vegas we participated in the Safelite marathon. The next day                                                                     Sibongile

beyond language. Since the young competitors
are required to spell words, while on stage, they
develop self-confidence, communication and
public speaking skills and the ability to thrive
under pressure.

AYLS45_The African Impact Award. - Emerging

 Emerging Leaders Foundation

It is often a challenge, especially in the African context, to talk about one's
accomplishments without appearing to be too proud or self-centred. But when
the whole continent recognizes your work, remaining silent might be too rude a
response to give.


Emerging Leaders Foundation was feted with the African Impact Award on the
16th of August 2019 at the National Museums of Kenya by the Voice Achievers
Award.


This award is in recognition of our work over the last seven years, during this
time, we have trained well over 20,000 young leaders in Kenya spread over 29
counties.


Leadership is pegged on the ability to influence; individuals, families,
organizations, communities and even nations. Everything, we believe, rises and
falls on leadership. That is why at ELF we are obsessed with adding tools to the
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS045EmergingLeadersFoundation","toolbox of young emerging leaders to prepare them for sustainable development
of their societies.


Our alumni have proceeded to become productive members of society,
championing for communities where people live with dignity and leadership is
values based.


Take a walk from Kilifi County where you will find our alumni involved in their
communities through activities like sports for change. You will find them in
Mombasa advocating for financial integrity in the county. In Makueni and
Murang'a they will be the ones mobilising fellow youth around issues and
promoting entrepreneursh ip for livelihood. They will be running for student
leadership positions in different universities and institutions of learning here in
Nairobi and beyond. In Narok and Migori, our alumni are championing for an end
to early marriage and FGM, and promoting the education girls in those counties.


In short, we have successfully invaded all the spheres of our society with the
contagious flu of values-based leadership which is proactive and transformative.
This award fans to flame our passion for the youth of Africa, besides rubber
stamping our place on the global map as the leading African organization on
matters youth leadership development and mentorship.


The Voice Achievers Award is a project of The Voice magazine and recognizes
Africans and friends of Africa for outstanding achievement on a yearly basis.
Among prominent Africans honoured by The Voice in the past are Dr. Kenneth
Kaunda, former President of Zambia, President Dr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President
of the Republic of Sierra Leone, Mrs. Fatou Bensouda, The Chief Persecutor of the
International Criminal Court (ICC), Ms. Miet Smet - President European
Parliamentarians for Africa, Apostle Hayford lkponmwosa Alike (OFR),
outstanding African diplomats and many more.


Thank you, Voice Magazine, for amplifying our voices and thank you Africa for
noticing our local contributions at a global arena.

LEADERS
ELF is in the business of identifying
polishing and supporting Africa's Young
                                                                     V
leaders. We prepare them to shape the
future of the continent through our three-
step model: Self Discovery, People
Connection, Community Impact.



Discover
Leaders must first discover and know who they are before embarking on making any
change in their communities. We guide participants in reflecting and articulating
narratives from their personal life journeys. Each leader in the program is tutored on
how to use the powerful art of storytelling to share the truths from triumphs and failures
that continue to shape their lives.

""We have to dare to be ourselves, however frightening or strange
that self may prove to be."" -   May Sarton

Connect
Establishing a connection with people is the first step to having influence in many
communities. We impart our young leaders with the fundamental skills for a good first
impression and developing an authentic connection when working with their target
constituency.
""We are all different. Don't judge, understand instead."" - Roy T Bennett

Impact
Leadership is about results. It's about making a real tangible difference in the lives of
communities. ELF works in partnership with organizations to offer internships,
exchange programs and work opportunities for the leaders in the making to start on
their impact journey.

ABOUT CHANGAMKA FELLOWSHIP
In a series of pre-election engagements of young people in Kenya's 2017 elections,
IFES Kenya through its IFES-GAC program proved that beyond developing avenues
and platforms of participation and interest among young people in the electoral, public
and political spaces; there was among other needs the want for structured mentorship
sessions on various topics among them self-development and economic
empowerment and impacting their communities.

It is upon this premise that IFES Kenya under the IFES-GAC program partnered with
Emerging Leaders Foundation (ELF), Emerging Leaders Foundation (ELF) - a
Leadership training, mentorship and coaching platform that concerns itself with
growing the next generation of value-driven and sufficiently tooled leaders for
transformative change in communities throughout the Global South.

ELF got into a contract with IFES Kenya on this program to mentor a group of 40
select young people aged between 18 and 30 years' old who had been part of a bigger
group dubbed the Campus Ambassadors.

 Emerging Leaders Foundation (ELF)

Emerging Leaders Foundation (ELF) is an African youth centered non-profit
organization that provides practical, values-based leadership development,
mentorship, governance and livelihoods training to promising young Africans,
so that they can become positive agents of sustainable social, economic and
political transformation in society. ELF exists to increase the participation of
young men and women in governance and policy processes in order to promote
dignity in society through increased accountability and service delivery on the
part of duty bearers. We believe that when youth are equipped with the relevant
knowledge, skills, and competencies, they begin to participate more strategically
and productively in leadership and governance processes.



OUR STORY
ELF was started in 2012 in Kenya to reach out to young people between 15 - 35
years, to help them discover their purpose, utilize their potential and become the
best they can be in life. In Kenya just like in other African countries, young people
account for more than 50 per cent of the total population.


As an organization, we believe that young people are the best resource that any
nation has to be able to sustain growth and prosperity. At the moment the reality
is that majority of young people in Kenya and Africa at large are in the periphery
of decision making and policy processes.
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS045EmergingLeadersFoundation","WHO WEARE
ELF is a leadership cradle that nurtures young African men and women with the
potential and promise of championing for positive change at the grassroots level.


We provide a platform for young people to reach inside for something bigger to
live for, and to thirst for knowledge and skills necessary to function optimally. We
encourage them to dream of a better world for all humanity starting with the
communities they call home.



OUR TEAM
The ELF core team consists of knowledgeable and experienced professionals
committed to all-rounded development of youth. They bring with them a wealth
of experience in organizational development, self-development, mentorship,
leadership, effective participation in governance, fundraising, grants
management, politics, gender perspectives, advocacy and capacity building.
The combined team expertise includes youth development, program assessment
and implementation, group work, behavior management, coaching, mentorship,
facilitation, curriculum development, leadership development and sustainable
development.

We emphasize on service to community by all fellows in the program because we
believe that when you teach you learn, and when you learn you must teach.



 Personal touch
We are personally in touch with all our current fellows and alumni and this helps
us to continuously support them and monitor their progress.



 Linkage
We link our fellows and alumni to high-impact events and forums nationally in
Kenya and at the continental level through the African Union Youth Division.



All-rounded training
We train our fellows/ participants to be all-rounded individuals



Gender Equality
We focus heavily on women but we also work with men to redefine
masculinity and help them to change their thinking and embrace partnership with

Mentorship
We pair up mentees/fellows with mentors according to their areas of interest or
need. The mentorship relationship is along gender lines but there are moments
when we do group mentorship with both men and women.

        changamka programme and one of
        the Tunaweza Fellow from Narok

moving story on how ELF has transformed
and shaped his life.

“...I had a great desire to be an agent of
change and serve people just like the Re-
nowned icons I looked up to like Mandela
and Martin Luther King Jr.

Their stories compelled me to be at service
to humankind. Before that life at the Univer-

dimmed at a point in my life when in 2009 I
had to drop out of school for 3 years...”

HIGHLIGHTS


  Having successfully done phase one of this project last year which culminated in the
  National Youth and Devolution Symposium in June 2018 which brought together about
  300 youth at the Kenya School of Government to discuss the place of young people in
  the devolution process, at the end of the symposium a position paper was presented to
  government (State department for youth affairs).

  FORD Foundation supported the scaling up of this project to four more counties (Kilifi,
  Makueni, Murang’a and Narok) in addition to the initial four counties (Uasin Gishu,
  Kericho, Migori and Bungoma).
                                                                       Page 1
  We successfully did a round of capacity building sessions from Kilifi to Bungoma form-
  ing
  a team of 15 champions of transparency and accountability in each of the counties.
  We are now in the process of planning for the 2nd Youth and Devolution Symposium
  in May to bring together all the participating counties in this project and invite all the
  other counties to come and learn and share information on how to position youth at the
  heart
  of devolution.

  We will later on have an exchange program between the participating counties to
  enhance learning and sharing and also to build a team of good governance champions
  who are networked across the country.

                                                                                    Page 6

JULIET AWUOR: ELF COHORT 6 MENTEE

    I have learnt to embrace rejection, that when I received an acceptance mail
    from Emerging Leaders Foundation, I decided to make the most of this fellow-
    ship.

    An eighteen-year-old girl goes to the clinic, accompanied by her first boy-
    friend, to treat what seemed like an STI. Nothing could have prepared her
    from the revelation. I tested positive for pregnancy, had an STI and turned out
    to be HIV positive. My dreams of pursuing education went down the drain. I
    remember going to the University of Nairobi to apply for the joint admissions
    board, given that I had scored a B-; and stood a chance of getting into the sys-
    tem. I never followed it through. I had a lot going on.

Imagine an incubation hub for emerging leaders across the continent. A place
where they can come and learn and share with one another as they get one-one
coaching from leading figures across the globe. We are talking about our own
“Chatham House” where African dignitaries, academicians and leading schol-
ars would be proud to come and make their contributions to matters of interna-
tional concern, a centre that would raise the profile of the continent and assert
the dignity of its people.

We dream of putting up a “warehouse” of leadership development and
mentorship.

  DEVOLUTION SYMPOSIUM, HELD ON 12TH AND 13th JUNE, 2019, AT AFRICA
  INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY, KAREN , NAIROBI


  A total of 300 youth delegates drawn from all the 47 counties of the Republic of Kenya,
  attended a 2-day meeting, dubbed the ‘2nd National Youth and Devolution Symposium’
  convened by Emerging Leaders Foundation (ELF). The symposium, whose theme was
  ‘Positioning the Youth at the Heart of Devolution’ was a culmination of work that ELF
  has been doing in 8 counties (Kilifi, Makueni, Murangá, Narok, Uasin Gishu, Bungoma,
  Migori and Kericho), working specifically to strengthen the capacity of youth in terms of
  how they engage their respective county governments.


  The over-arching objective of the symposium was for the youth drawn from across the
  country to reflect on the progress made in attaining the youth agenda through devolution,
  discuss the pitfalls and explore other emergent issues and opportunities, going forward.


  Overall, the participants noted that:
1. Kenya has an enabling policy, legal, institutional and constitutional framework that
   provides opportunities for realization and implementation of the youth agenda, in a
   manner that fulfils their aspirations. However, all these opportunities are impeded by
   rampant corruption and wanton theft of public resources in both the county and national
   level.
2. Emerging Leaders Foundation, together with other youth serving organizations in the
   non-state actors’ group, have played a significant role in supporting youth initiatives,

   enabling youth to realize socio-economic and political aspirations.


3. Devolution remains a pivotal platform on which youth can prosecute their agenda in a
   manner that is constructive, progressive and sustainable.

4. Statutory, periodic elections offer an opportunity for youths to access positions of power
   and exert their influence in championing youth related issues, both at the National and
   County Assemblies.

5. The Access to Government Procurement Opportunities (AGPO) program, if implemented
   as it should, is a progressive intervention for socio-economic empowerment of the youth
   in the country.

6. Depression and extreme gambling among the youth are the emerging vices in the country
   that need urgent government action at both national and county level.


   Going forward, the delegates agreed that:


1. Devolution is still a work in progress, with multiple loopholes both in law and
   implementation. Its success is hinged, in part, on robust public participation, especially
   from the youths
2. The National Government’s Big Four Agenda offers a defined avenue through which
   youth can deepen their participation in devolution, especially in view of the ongoing plans
   to align these 4 sectors (manufacturing, job creation, universal health and affordable
   housing) with the developmental plans of the devolved units.


3. Politics and hero-leadership has taken undue status in the country. Political competition
   has taken precedence over development planning.

4. Oversight in the county governments has been marred with multi-layered conflicts of
   interest by players.

   forge, at the county level, to consolidate their agenda, expand their platform and amplify
   their voice as a united front.



   Finally, the delegates recommended that:


1. For effective promotion of youth development projects, county governments in
   partnership with all stakeholders should make deliberate efforts to develop youth-centred
   development programmes informed by an all-inclusive consultative process.
2. The Ministry of Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs, through the State Department
   of Youth needs to harness youth-serving efforts at all levels of National and County
   government to leverage on available platforms for young people. This can be achieved
   through an inter-agency for information sharing and programme coordination.
3. All county governments take up open tender systems to weed out institutionalised
   corruption in that sector.


4. There is need for county governments to increase responsiveness to youth issues, not only
   in policy articulation in the CIPDs, but also through budgetary allocations and visible,
   auditable projects.


5. All youth across the country ought to support the government’s renewed war on
   corruption, which has had pervasive effects on youths by curtailing their participation in
   governance and access to government services.


6. All youth ought to embrace a value-driven life especially those in positions of
   responsibility. This is, in many ways, the anchor of good governance.

7. Individuals and institutions working within youth spaces especially at the county level,
   should seek to build networks, eliminate silo mentality and define common issues that
   they can pursue collectively.

       from devolution, a lot more needs to be done in adjusting the current policy, legal,
       regulatory and institutional framework to respond to emerging realities on youth issues.
       The approval of the Draft National Youth Policy needs to be expedited by the Cabinet.


Overall, it is our aspiration that more partners, both state and non-state, will work together, to
continue bringing youth and youth-led organizations, at the center of policy making within their
respective counties.


Ahead of the 3rd Youth and Devolution Symposium in 2019, we expect to see the following,
among other things:
      Increased public awareness of the role of youth in implementation of devolution in
       Kenya. Specifically, deepening their awareness of the opportunity to take part in policy
       and decision-making in their respective counties.
      Constructive engagement and influence of youth in the devolved functions
      Strengthened capacity and role of youth and local organizations in implementation of
       devolution.
      Strengthened accountability mechanisms for youth actors in the devolution space.

Ratification of the Position Paper:
The participants unanimously agreed with the contents of this position paper, and by motion, the
following two delegates ratified it on behalf of the other participants:
   1. Ms. Winnie Mukosi – Delegate, Makueni County
   2. Mr. Ken Ruto – Delegate, Uasin Gishu County

Alumni associations
As a Commonwealth Alumnus, we encourage you to join a local alumni association in your home country, or in the country in which
you are currently living or working.

Our alumni associations are coordinated by alumni volunteers who are responsible for organising a range of local events and
activities which encourage networking and ongoing professional development. In certain countries, alumni associations are
supported by the British Council (on behalf of the CSC), which assists in establishing and strengthening these groups.

All CSC alumni events are advertised on our Calendar. If you do not receive an invite to an event happening near you, please
contact us at alumni@cscuk.org.uk

Each alumni association is different, from the types of events they organise to their membership requirements. A list of current
alumni associations and contact information can be found below.

The CSC is not responsible for the content of external sites or the operation of alumni associations.

Call for volunteers
If your country is not listed below, then an alumni association has not yet been set up. If you are interested in volunteering to
coordinate an association, or organising a local event to re-connect with fellow alumni , please get in touch with us at
alumni@cscuk.org.uk

Development Training Programme 2019-2020
Background


Development Training is a key part of the Commonwealth Scholarship award. The CSC aims to equip
Commonwealth Scholars with the skills to effect real development impact on their return home, as well as
to create a community of motivated Commonwealth Scholars through an extensive programme of training
and networking.


CSC Virtual Engagement Programme


With the unfolding Covid-19 crisis in the UK, the CSC took the decision in mid-March to cancel all planned
face to face events for the rest of the academic year to safeguard the health and wellbeing of our Scholars
and staff involved in delivering these events, and to comply with Government guidance. Since then we
have been looking into alternative ways of ensuring Scholars and alumni can continue to network and
engage with each other through our events and training, and therefore we are pleased to announce the
start of our Virtual Engagement Programme of events, activities and training for 2020.


Our first virtual site visit chats took place in May with Scholars based at Liverpool Hope University,
Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the University of Liverpool.
We have also hosted virtual site visits with Scholars based in Wales, Bath, London and Leeds.


With further virtual site visits planned in June and July, we hope you will be able to join CSC staff and
fellow Scholars at one of these informal meetups soon. Please see the list of proposed virtual site visits
below.

                                       researcher for World Agroforestry Center-lCRAF in Nairobi. It is at ICRAF where her interest in
                                        sustainable development developed. She now works towards combining business cases, environmental
                                       rationale and social logic to address the selfishness and apathy of the ones responsible of managing

of mechanisms and formulation of legislative which will back up the integration of development goals and environmental

                                             State. His research is in campus sustainability, specifically the use of solar photovoltaic in promoting
                                             green buildings at universities.

                                             Nutifafa believes that action speaks louder than words, and that what wings are to a bird is what
                                             education is to those who receive it. For this reason, he founded T-Action Global, an organisation
                                             which awards scholarships, promotes third party scholarship opportunities, and provides support and
                                             guidance to scholarship applicants, as a means of giving back to his community.

As the Knowledge Hub Coordinator (Alumni) of the climate change resilience and mitigation hub, Nutifafa hopes to facilitate
discussions and exchange ideas among Commonwealth Scholars to advance action towards addressing the causes and impacts
of climate change.

AYLS93_0verview I Commonwealth Scholarship
Commission in the UK_Simplified


Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in the
UK
The CSC's evaluation and monitoring (E&M) programme aims to:
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS093_CommonwealthScholarship","   • Monitor the experiences, satisfaction, and performance of Commonwealth Scholars and Fellows
   • Identify and measure the outcomes and impact of Commonwealth Scholarships and Fellowships on
      individuals, institutions, and communities and societies
   • Contribute to the CSC's learning processes and inform strategic and operational decision-making
   • Strengthen accountability and communicate outcomes to award holders, funders, and other
      stakeholders
The E&M programme is coordinated by a team at the CSC Secretariat and overseen by the CSC's Evaluation
and Monitoring Committee.



Approach




The CSC uses a variety of methods to gather evidence relating to the outcomes and impact of its eight
scholarship schemes. In particular, we aim to track individual trajectories to determine personal award
outcomes, as well as exploring the cumulative impact of awards on wider socioeconomic development.


Surveys
Each year we send out surveys to incoming Commonwealth Scholars and Fellows and alumni to gather
information about their pre- and post-scholarship/fellowship careers. From alumni, we collect details on
the knowledge and skills that they gained during their award, and their ability to apply these skills in the
workplace after returning home. We also ask for details of their activities, and the impact they are having in
key development sectors.


We are also interested in the experiences and views of other stakeholders and partners; we survey hosts,
employers, and overseas nominating agencies. We also undertake ad hoc survey exercises.


Findings from these surveys are reported to the CSC's E&M Committee and the wider Commission, and are
also P-Ublished for wider dissemination.




Interviews and focus group discussions

interviews and focus group discussions. These activities enable us to gain an in-depth understanding of the
successes of our alumni and the challenges that they face in their careers, as well as providing a wealth of
rich information about wider outcomes and impact.


As with surveys, the E&M team has also initiated interviews and focus groups with hosts and supervisors, in
order to better understand their experiences of the programme and to document its benefits to UK
universities and host organisations.



Developing new tools and methods
Over the past ten years, the E&M programme has developed and refined its methods, building on an initial
(essential) tracing and survey exercise. We have experimented with counterfactual approaches, aligned
data collection tools across programmes to allow for future comparative review, and developed a new
longitudinal survey methodology. Upcoming priorities include building on existing qualitative work, and
developing new and improved means of publishing and disseminating our findings.



Scholarship evaluation: collaborating with others
The CSC is continually striving to improve its approach to scholarship evaluation. As well as attending
relevant workshops, seminars, and other events within the evaluation and higher education sectors, the
E&M team works closely with external colleagues in the UK and overseas to share experiences and
knowledge wherever possible. In addition to our own P-Ublications, we work with the Association of
Commonwealth Universities to curate the 'Measuring Success?' blog series, featuring contributions from
colleagues throughout the sector discussing their experiences of analysing the outcomes of scholarships
and of evidence-informed policymaking.

BUT WHAT GENERATION DO YOU WANT TO BE?
Imagine the KECTIL Generation ••••


We are youth not defined by the year we were born. We are defined by our focus on a
future that demands our attention. We are the youth leaders of Developing Countries.
Toe:ether as a e:lobal team we are called to chane:e our communities for the better. And
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS136_KectilGeneration","we have the strength to do it.

Positive.

   1. Positivity begins with ourselves. Self-confidence starts by finding our inner strength. This inner
     strength makes us ready to change the world around us.
   2. We train our minds by learning as much as possible about the world we live in. We read and study
     purposefully. We look at all angles and consider all views with respect. We absorb information and
     then check it for accuracy or bias.
   3. We are honest and reliable.
   4. We treat everyone with kindness and compassion, especially when we disagree.
   5. We are positive role models for both the old and the young.
   6. We each contribute our own special skills to the goal and look for others who can contribute as
     well. It is together that we form the necessary whole.
   7. We abide by the Kectil Code to equally respect everyone regardless of nationality, religion, culture,
     ethnicity or gender.
   8. We know we will be successful because we have to be. We will not settle for less.

Change.

   1. We demand good honest government.
   2. We reject and expose corruption. Corruption has devastating effects on Youth and it has to stop.
   3. We, as Males being Promise Leaders and Females also doing their part, will support and encourage
     each other's well-being through respect and encouragement.
   4. We fight for the improvement of our environment, from small tasks such as picking up garbage, to
     living a sustainable lifestyle to tackling large waste projects.
   5. We acknowledge the problem of overpopulation and disproportionate growth in developing
     countries, and we study its projected effects on our future.
   6. We innovate and create using the best of our talents to improve the quality of life.
   7. We strongly reject prejudices and hatred based on nationality, religion, culture, ethnicities, social
     position and gender, which have been imposed on us. We accept everyone and expect the same
     from them.
   8. We reach out to youth in other countries to create the global network for change. We commit to
     forming life-long unbreakable bonds. And we commit our support.

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS136_KectilGeneration","We are adding another 1000 to our previously reached goal of 1000!

In 2019, Kectil launched an initiative called ""1000 Males Campaign"" on its website. We challenged males
to stand up to a large leadership role to protect females in their societies.
We successfully met the goal with 1000 Male Pledges from more than 72 countries in the world! That is a
big milestone for us, and we are so proud to receive messages from Promise Keepers saying how they
have been keeping their promises after pledging a year ago.
We publicly honor those males who participated and acted as they promised! We have set a new goal
where those who have already pledged can promise again while still inviting others to join!

2000 Male Promise Keepers!!

The Malmar Knowles Family Foundation and The Kectil Program are excited to announce that the male
pledges portal is now reopened! In 2019, we successfully reached the goal of attaining 1000 pledges with
the support of 1000 brave males from 72 countries. We have been motivated to take this legacy up a
notch by launching the ""2000 Males Campaign"". Yes, we have decided to double the goal!
With more males involved in protecting females, the communities will indefinitely get better for
everyone. With that belief, we ask men to stand up and act as ""Promise Keepers"" to take care of the girls
and women in their society, to profess their commitment to the females at large, and to protect females
against any forms of violence.
We call for males to take the following pledge:
1. When you see a female you find atractive, you must ask yourself this VERY important question. ""If I am
with this female and she gets pregnant, would I be willing to take care of her and the baby with a full
commitment?"" If the answer is no, then put your hands in your pocket and walk away.
2. I agree not to hit or physically attack a female.
3. I agree to keep my eyes open as a protector to identify situations in which a female is at risk and will
try to take reasonable steps to help if possible.
4. I will encourage other males to take the Kectil Promise Leaders Pledge.
If you have already participated in ""1000 Males Campaign"", we encourage you to continue the pledge at
the website and keep up your mission of protecting females you took up and share the message to other
men.
If you have not, please do now!
One man can't make a change, but together we can definitely bring a better world for our females, girls,
our future daughters and granddaughters.

The Kectil Program


    The lectil Generation
      Positive. Change.
Mission
The Kectil Program was created to identify and nurture highly talented youth in developing countries
who have the potential to make a positive difference in their communities and countries.


Framework

We accomplish our Mission Statement by:
We accomplish our Mission Statement by (i) facilitating innovative leadership training and (ii) providing a
means to allow these highly talented youth become part of a guided network with other similarly
talented and passionate youth in developing countries who will support, nurture, teach and learn from
each other as they mature.
The Kectil Framework embodies both of the goals of the famous African proverb:
   ""Ifyou want to go fast, go alone; ifyou want to go far, go together.""


Kectil Code

The Kectil Code is the framework of the Kectil Program. Each participant is required to comply with
the Kectil Code.

   • Each participant shall be referred to as a Kectil Colleague and shall treat others as Colleagues.
   • Each Kectil Colleague will give equal respect to every other Kectil Colleague regardless of
      nationality, religion, culture or gender.
   • Each Kectil Colleague will discuss ideas and contributions of other Kectil Colleagues with positive,
      collaborative and respectful comments.
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS136_KectilGeneration","     • Each Kectil Colleague will honor the Developing Country Youth Leadership Network by creating
         positive, lasting bonds with other Kectil Colleagues with the intent to stay connected and
         positively support each other toward future leadership that adds value to the local and national
         community.
     • Each Kectil Colleague will carry out all the assignments of the program.
     • Each Kectil Colleague will use best effort to attend each webcast of the program.
     • Kectil Colleagues uphold the honor of the Kectil Program by treating others in his/her community
         with respect and compassion.
     • Kectil Colleagues will not take non-prescribed drugs or misuse alcohol.
     • If selected to attend the Developing Country Youth Leadership Conference in Atlanta, the Kectil
         Colleague will conduct himself/herself in a manner that is a role model for others and will be an
         excellent representative of his/her community.


The Kectil Program

""KECTIL"" is an acronym that refers to the Knowles Educational and Charitable Trust for
International Leadership.
The Kectil Program is based of the following principals:

     • Creating an authentic, collaborative network of high potential youth from developing and least
         developed countries can break down prejudices, lead to cultural, religious and gender
         understanding and give youth the comfort that they are more than just themselves- they are part
         of a mutual youth-based support system with the goal to make a positive difference in their lives,
         their Colleagues' lives and the lives of those in their communities.
     • Identifying, embracing and mentoring high potential youth (17-26) from developing and least
         developed countries can have a dramatic effect on the youths' dreams, service to others and life
         accomplishments.
     • Nothing comes easy and there is ""no free lunch."" The results will not be achieved without hard
         work, dedication and an open mindedness to cultural understanding and compassion.

The Program works to achieve these goals in three parts: a one-year Web-based Program, the
Developing Youth Leadership Conference in Atlanta, United States, and the Alumni Network.
Due to logistics and cost, more applicants can be accepted for the Web-based Program than the
Developing Youth Leadership Conference in Atlanta. If an applicant is accepted for the Web-based
Program but not the Developing Youth Leadership Conference, the applicant can apply the next year to
attend the Conference. All applicants accepted for either (i} the Web-based Program or (ii} the Web-
based Program and the Leadership Conference are encouraged to join and actively participate in the
Alumni Network at the end of the Program.

Developing Countries Youth Leadership Conference

Atlanta, Georgia

July 19th - July 27th, 2019

The Kectil Program hosted it's second one-week intensive leadership conference in Atlanta, Georgia. The
workshop will take place from July 22nd- July 27th, 2019. The Kectil Program selected thirty-one
participants from 15 developing countries to attend. The countries represented are Colombia, Egypt,
Guyana, India, Israel, Kenya, Lesotho, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saint Lucia, South Africa, Uganda,
Turkmenistan and Vietnam.
The conference held at the Georgia Institute of Technology Campus included intensive leadership
training on various topics moderated by Kectil Program Founder and Executive Director Sherry M.
Knowles. We were thrilled to have Mr. Martin Luther King Ill, Kectil Program Advisory Board Member, and
a Human Rights Advocate and Community Activist joining us during the conference with his daughter
Yolanda King for personal discussions with the youth.
We also had our advisory board member Dr. Alison Montgomery joining us to present a talk on
techniques for raising funds for community efforts and larger scale community projects. Dr. Montgomery
is highly experienced in the area of grants and loans for developing countries. We were also very
honored to be able to have a presentation by Dr. George Luber, a noted environmental
activist who studies the effect of climate on disease demographics. He is the Chief of the Climate and
Heath Program for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (""CDC"") in Atlanta.
We were also pleased to that AT&T, the huge telecommunications and entertainment company, invited
us to tour its AT&T Drive Studio in downtown Atlanta. We received a talk about AT& T's innovative efforts
to use the internet in all aspects of transportation and commerce. In addition, we were also invited to
tour the world headquarters for the business operations of The Coca-Cola Company. We will received
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS136_KectilGeneration","talks from Coca-Cola executives and the youth
were able to have photo opportunities there.
The highlight of the conference however, was the youth participants country presentation. Each
participant gave a one-hour presentation on their country's geography, history, culture, demographics
and the political and social environment. The youth also shared with us what it is like to grow up in their
country, the youth challenges, education, mentoring and how to identify and support transformational
youth leaders from their countries.
A critical aspect of the Conference was to create a youth leadership network of these highly talented
individuals who will form the Kectil Generation. They will support and draw from each other after the
conference and as they mature and take on various roles in their lives. Toward that end the Conference
include activities that are bonding experiences as well as ample time to discuss key topics facing each of
their communities.

The 1st African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) convened from 26th - 27th
October, 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, on the theme “African Youth Responses to Climate
Change and Food Security, Action from the Frontline.” The conference was organized by Africa
Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) in partnership with Africa Climate Policy Center
(ACPC), New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), Pan African Climate Justice
Alliance (PACJA) and Zimbabwe United Nations Association (ZUNA).
100 youths selected across Africa in the conference addressing the thematic strands of Youth in
Agribusiness; Climate Change and Development in Africa; Sustainable Agriculture and Food
Security; Green Economy and Technology Transfer; Climate Justice and Human Rights; and
Climate Change and Disaster risk reduction participated in this first edition of the African Youth
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC). This came at a time when Africa as a continent
continues to bear the biggest brunt of climate change due to low resilience and weak capacities,
with the youth despite their huge numbers and innovativeness among the vulnerable alongside
women. Despite the odds, they have been actively engaged in adaptation and mitigation




                                                                   O
initiatives that improve their communities’ resilience to climate change.
The conference therefore provided a platform for the African youths to interact and share best
practices. Five flagship projects were selected to be used as case studies by African Youths in
starting their own projects depending on transferability. The conference also saw the drafting of




                                                M
African youth position for COP 21 which was handed over to African Group of Negotiators at the
fifth Climate Change and Development in Africa Conference (CCDA V).

(AfriYOCC-2016)

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the environmental challenge of climate
change is already modifying Africa’s economies and livelihoods, health, social structure,
infrastructure and natural systems. Over the years, African youth have proved their potential in
both promoting and implementing climate change adaptation projects in their communities.
Their innovations have continually been adopted in responding to climate change impacts. This
is despite various challenges that include low capacity and education, high rates of poverty and
lack of financial resources. At the same time, African youth have been minimally represented in
the respective country policy processes as well as during the UNFCCC climate change
negotiations. Above 50% of the African population are the youth. This justifies the urgent need
for youth capacity development to respond to climate change and inclusion as key stakeholders
in policy process and negotiations. AYICC aims to spearhead new innovations, look into new
systems of success to share with policy and decision-makers, and generally aim to improve on
the current system which is causing long-term and irreversible degradation to our livelihoods –
as the leading youth organization on climate change in Africa.



                                                                    O
In cognizance of the role and potential of the African youth in climate change mitigation and
adaptation and overall sustainable development trajectory, the second African Youth




                                                 M
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC), shall be held in Nairobi, Kenya on 10th to 13th
October, 2016 as AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its formation in 2006 during the
second Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12. Building on the success of the first




                                               E
edition of conference, AfriYOCC shall provide an avenue for African youths to showcase their
climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, projects and initiatives. Best practices
arising from the various AYICC country chapters shall be developed to an African youth




                                    D
climate change adaptation and mitigation best practices database and handbook. The
meeting will dilate on the current post 2015 development agenda and the role of young
people in championing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in
Africa.

The delegates shall have an opportunity to visit ongoing Climate Change adaptation and
agribusiness projects in Kenya for hands-on skills and knowledge replicable in their countries.
Consequently, it shall boost the skills and capacities of African youths to substantially contribute
to the process leading towards and during COP 22. Through partnership with both
Governmental and Non-governmental agencies, the conference shall not only negotiate for
more youth representation in the respective country policy processes towards the forthcoming
CoPs and country specific policies, but also provide learning and engagement opportunities for
African youths. This will greatly enhance their current capacity and potential to actively
participate in both national and international platforms for policy formulation and implementation.
The conference will also provide a platform to re-assess the current position of our negotiators
and create awareness about the critical role young people should play in shifting agendas in the
forthcoming Conference of Parties in Marrakech come November 2016. While a 4 day gathering

issues affecting their livelihoods.

African youth have for long been side-lined to the periphery of the substantive civic and policy
issues facing the continent. However, the worst affected are the rural based youths and those
residing in farming communities, peri-urban areas and those from conflict and post conflict
countries. This has resulted in youths from these marginalized communities having no
knowledge and information on the basic climate change science and adaptation and mitigation
mechanisms. The good news though is that there is capacity amongst many young people who
are already in the circles of upcoming academia, policy specialists, lawyers, journalists and
scientists’ alike. These capacities need to be strengthened and skills shared amongst the wider
group of young people on the continent so that best practices are disseminated and resources
are expanded.

While it is an undeniable fact that climate change is affecting all regions globally, especially in
developing countries, the adverse effects in the future is likely to increase if the Paris agreement
is not ratified and effectuated by all parties. And even though a deal was achieved during
COP21 in Paris, the impacts of climate change will definitely continue into the future. This
suggests that young people will have to not just understand what climate change is and how it is




                                                                      O
affecting our world, opportunities that exists within, but most importantly, participate actively into
finding amicable solutions. Young people of Africa have therefore considered it an inherent
imperative to contribute to their future by organizing the 2nd African Youth Conference on
Climate Change in October 2016 under the theme, ‘Making Climate Finance work for




                                                  M
African Youth.’


2.1 CONFERENCE STRATEGY




                                                E
The conference program shall be based on exploring mechanisms to finance climate adaptation
and mitigation through Innovations in agriculture, technology and other sectors. It shall be




                                     D
highly interactive with unique workshop-style design that enables participants to develop their
potential through practical experience. Participants will divide to participate in thematic
workshops and come up with an African Youth position paper and concrete activities to be
included in the African Youth Strategy on Climate Change.

The delegates shall be engaged in pre-conference activities that shall include and not limited to,
mapping of youth climate change and/or mitigation projects within the conference key focus
areas for selection as best practice and include in the African youth climate change adaptation
and mitigation best practices database and handbook and aggressively fundraise towards their
participation and a successful workshop. The conference shall critically examine the various
country positions and the overall continents positions of the African Group of Negotiators, their
achievements and potentials towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It shall
examine the youth voices in these positions and further develop African youth position for
COP22.

We expect 200 youth leaders to participate in this conference. The conference is convened by
the AYICC continental secretariat in collaboration with AYICC Kenya chapter and the member

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is an umbrella youth network of African
based youth organizations, university groups, rural youth groups, schools, and individuals
working on climate change and sustainable development issues. It aims at developing capacity
and strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent need to take action
against the impacts of climate change for both present and future generations.

The initiative (always referred to as the movement) was conceived in Nairobi Kenya 10 years
ago, during the second Conference of Youth (COY2) preceding the 12th Conference of Parties
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC - COP12). The
main reason for its founding was to ensure the inclusion, and active participation of youths from
the south, and specifically Africa, in the international climate change negotiations. This was
needed as the youth are more than half the African population and are most affected by climate
change impacts. They also got massive potential to support the continent to take action on
global warming.

During its formation, it comprised of 8 country chapters and current has grown to 45 country
chapters with over 20,000 members across Africa and the Diaspora. This initiative has provided




                                                                  O
a platform for knowledge, ideas and experiences sharing. It is also an avenue for development
of skills and strategies on youth action on climate change mitigation and adaptation in the
African continent. AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a
platform for them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the




                                               M
UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others.

Since its inception, we have worked in partnership with international youth movements and have




                                             E
played a great role in the establishment of the International Youth Climate Movement whose
youth member organizations are now officially acknowledged by the UNFCCC as the YOUNGO
(Youth NGOs involved in the climate change negotiations process). Since COY2 in Nairobi, it




                                   D
has had youth delegates’ representation in all COP meetings.

In addition to the above, we have had landmark successes that include:
     A reach out programme for a children’s home (Watoto Wema in Ruai) and School
        climate change education program run in selected schools in Kenya.
     Leadership and mentorship programmes especially on volunteerism.
     Community development projects particularly on clean energy (energy saving stoves for
        rural folks)
     Capacity development of youth on agribusiness
     Advocacy campaigns e.g. lobbied for lanes to be set aside along the major highways for
        non-motorised transport especially for cyclists.
     Policy engagements i.e. contributing to the climate change bill 2012,as stakeholders
     Youth Caravan from Kenya to Durban during COP 17

African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) www.ayicc.net is a continental youth network that was conceived in 2006 in Nairobi Kenya, during the
Conference of Youth held just before the UNFCCC COP12. This initiative has continued to link, and share knowledge, ideas, experiences, skills and strategies
on youth action around the continent on climate change, its mitigation and adaptation and sustainable development. In 2009, AYICC was granted observer
status to the African Minister Conference on Environment (AMCEN). AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a platform for
them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the Conference of Parties of UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others. AYICC
currently operates in over 45 African countries with over 20,000 members.

In response, to the call by AU Heads of Sates and Government to establish the CAHOSCC Youth Programme on Climate Change (CYPCC),

Founding Opportunities


AYICC Founding Opportunities

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the
environmental challenge of climate change will ultimately modify Africa's economies and livelihoods, health, social structure, infrastructure and natural
systems. To date little has been done to empower, capacitate and mobilise youth, particularly in Africa to address global environmental challenges such as
climate change. facebook d o w n ~ To remedy this, an initial step has been the formation of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC).

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change was formed partially in response to the poor representation of young Africans at the International Youth
Summit on Climate Change (November 24-28, 2005), which was held in conjunction with the United Nation's Climate Change Conference (November 28-
December 10, 2005) in Montreal , Canada. The overall mission of AYICC is to ensure that African youth are equipped toparticipate in future UNFCCC
meetings and other global initiatives for sustainable solutions to environmental degradation and climate change.

In order to ensure a strong youth presence in climate change dialogue and fora, there is a need for AYICC to ensure youth representation from various parts
of Africa. This will enable Africa's youth to engage with the global youth movement, governments and NGO's in a more coordinated and sustained manner.
The long term goal is to ensure sustainable and systematic global youth action, with special emphasis on African youth on the issue of climate change.

Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any financial assistance. The planning committee members have
volunteered their time and their contributions. However, in order to make this vision a reality we need to become a financially viable organisation. For this
reason, we would like to request your financial assistance in getting this vision off the ground.•

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE ADF 7 OPENING FORUM, 12TH OCT.10

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE OPENING FORUM OF THE SEVENTH AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FORUM, 12TH OCTOBER

2010: Ms. Esther Agbarakwe, Nigeria




The Chair,

Climate Change poses significant challenges to future generations. As youth we have a stake in this future; it is our future.




                                                                                                                 O
As the 7th African Development Forum, we have indeed come of age, we are no longer in our childhood stages of determining sustainable development - the
time of maturity has arrived. This year is marked as the International Year of Youth and now, more than ever before, the youth are taking a stand. More than
anyone else, we, the Youth, face unprecedented challenges as a result of global climate change. We also share the responsibility of addressing ii. As a group,
we are key moral stakeholders in the international processes treating the most important challenge of our generation. As it is our future, we will be
disproportionately affected by the catastrophic impacts of climate change.

Advocacy and Behavior Change: II is critical for present and future leaders to collaborate on finding solutions. The need for cultural transformation in our time




                                                                              M
is stronger than ever. This transformation - that enables us to shift towards a more sustainable world - should be an organic process, guided by principles of
compassion, integrity and justice. We need to pragmatically rethink our behavioral patterns, to enable a paradigm shift that is based on an ongoing process of
action, reflection and meaningful participation. Awareness, education and empowerment are fundamental prerequisites to enabling this process, and the youth
are energetic and passionate about holding governments and all relevant stakeholders involved accountable for their actions. We are equal partners in this
process and commit ourselves fully to achieving the objectives as decided by this Forum.




                                                                            E
Contrary to what is believed; young people play a dynamic role in framing and implementing policies. So their role goes beyond advocacy. From an advocacy
perspective, young people are involved in songs and stories which spread awareness in local languages. Of course we understand the importance and
relevance of this because 70% of Africa is based in rural areas and the term Climate Change is foreign, Young people are finding ways of using words in local
languages to translate the message across.




                                                           D
It is time to shift the balance of decision-making towards the generation that will have to manage this unwanted inheritance, to make political and economic
decisions that can span a generation, and to enable real inter-generational and inter-cultural dialogue about climate change to be realized in institutions where
the youth generation can learn.

However at the same time a range of social learning and marketing approaches need to be developed to address the gap between classroom education styles
and education that stimulates real action. This gap prevents the cultural shift from token awareness to personal action and reaction.

Education: In relation to climate change, African Governments should begin at inception to mainstream youth voices and perceptions. This is particularly
important because climate change projections indicate that effects will begin to be most felt in the next 20-30 years - young people should begin to be part of
the solution so that they will be able to cope when disaster calls. Involving them in this programme will ensure that those who will be affected will have direct
knowledge of the challenges and strategies for coping as well as the ability to mobilize communities to respond to and prepare for the impact of climate change
and natural disasters.

Governments must give credence to the higher learning education system in Africa in particular the increased accent on improvement of research and
innovation on climate change specifically highlighting on policy and reform, the programmes, pedagogy and teaching tools. This will enhance an equipped pool
of intellectual capital among the young people on climate change issues who will replicate this to the various organizations and networks that they are part of.

Al government level, during the last Conference of the Parties (COP), ii was pleasing to see that many African delegations included youth and gave them a role
to play. Furthermore, many youth who were involved in COP 15 deliberations have been interacting with their various governments and engaging in processes
and procedures that are related to Climate change policy. There is an understanding that more needs to be done, and at this forum, I urge you to engage young
people who knock on your doors asking to be involved.

Youth and youth based NGOs play a major role either in strengthening local capacity to cope or by supporting local action. Already, groups such as the Nigerian
Youth Coalition and the African youth Climate Initiative-Kenya have established school climate clubs, which are creative ways to engage young people; these
initiatives should be mainstreamed into education systems. Young people in this governance process are important because successful adaptation requires a
host of innovative measures developed with vulnerable communities to improve their present and future livelihoods. Young people are vibrant and are able to
access places that many governmental institutions fail to access. As the majority of the population and Africa's future, it is important to include them in this
impending crisis that is Climate Change.

Already, this conference calls for integrated approaches to enable African countries to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change. There is a dire need
to have a clearer understanding of the potential calamities that climate change can bring and to start the discourse on how best to stave off the worst impacts.
There is already an understanding that

Climate Change is not a localized problem but transcends national borders, hence the need for co-operation of Intergovernmental agencies but also to include
those young and vulnerable people.

It is a combination of both, which needs the involvement of
young people to preserve the environment and enter into green energy careers.

It's important for all of us to recognize that sustainable development isn't just a catch phrase - people all over the continent are taking it into their own hands. A
couple days ago over 300 community events took place in nearly every country on the continent of Africa, and more than 7000 globally as part of the Global
Work Party on 10/10/10.

Everywhere in the wortd, people planted trees, cultivated community gardens, installed solar panels, made buildings more efficient and implemented thousands
of other grassroots solutions to the climate crisis. We got to work everywhere in the world, but we need you, leaders, to get to work, too.

Thank you and God bless

                        African Youth at COP25

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS143_AfricanYouthCouncilonClimateChange","The 25th session of the Conference Parties (COP25) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held from the 2 -13
December bringing together nearly 27000 people to the Spanish capital. COP25
provided parties with the opportunity to finalize the ""rulebook"" of the Paris
Agreement - the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020.


In the spirit of the convention on climate change young people continue to enjoy




                                                                          O
various spaces during COP mainly through YOU NGO; the official youth
constituency to the UNFCCC. Article 6 ofthe Convention and Article 12 of the
Paris Agreement referred to as Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) encourage
the empowerment of every member of the society to take climate actions and
therefore young people who are most vulnerable to the climate crisis are




                                             M
increasingly becoming the centre of discussion.


The world today is home to the largest generation of young people in history and
their energy, creativity, and innovation, when harnessed properly, will accelerate




                                           E
sustainable solutions to the global crisis. Youth have a pivotal role to play in the
implementation of ACE which consists of six elements namely: education,
training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and
international cooperation.




                             D
At COP25, the Intergenerational Inquiry which is a highlight event of Young and
Future Generations Day and like every year provided a platform for youth and
decision-makers to discuss how young people can enhance the implementation
of the Paris Agreement. This platform was attended by the Executive Secretary of
the UNFCCC and provided an opportunity for young people to share the
outcome on the Conference of Youth (COY 15) to the secretariat.


The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) has continued to
empower and mobilize young people at COP through our side events and
exhibitions. Through an exhibition at COP 25, AYICC was able to showcase the
actions and contributions of African youth in the fight against climate change.
Such actions include ecological restorations, renewable energy promotion, and
local conference of youth hosted by our national chapters.


AYICC's greatest concern however, is with regards to the low representation of
African youth at the UNFCCC sessions. There are many contributing factors which
includes lack of funding, inability to assess accreditations and visas. As the first
step in addressing this, we will continue to encourage African countries to make
conscious efforts to include youth delegates in their official delegations for COPs.
We also call on development partners and stakeholders who are interested in
youth development to reach out with their support to AYICC to enhance African
youth participation in this important global process.

Climate Change


• Campaigns and Advocacy
 The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is widely known for our
 incessant campaigns and research-based advocacy on environmental and
 climate change topics. Since 2006 AYICC has been consistent with its
 campaigns impressing on African governments and international community
 alike to deliver on their commitment under the United Nations Framework
 Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) .



• Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)
 Climate change education, training, and awareness creation have been the
 central focus of AYICC targeting youth and vulnerable communities. We do
 this through workshops, conferences, and webinars leveraging on our robust
 online presence. Through our Flagship program; the African Youth Conference
 on Climate Change (AFRIYOCC) we are able to provide a platform for




                                                                     O
 exchange of ideas and sharing of knowledge and best practices among young
 African thereby feeding into article 6 of the climate change convention and
 article 12 of the Paris Agreement.



• Tree planting and Ecological restoration



                                         M
 Trees contribute to their environment by providing oxygen, improving air
 quality, climate amelioration, conserving water, preserving soil, and




                                       E
 supporting wildlife. Beyond the campaigns and advocacies, our member
 organizations embark on tree planting and reforestation activities including
 mangrove restoration along the coast.




                         D
• Renewable energy promotion
 With the increasing demand for energy for industrial and economic
 development, AYICC member organizations in different countries are
 promoting renewable energy access to isolated off-grid communities. AYICC
 believes that Youth-led renewable energy enterprises are a viable means of
 achieving sustainable development, as they promote technologies that are
 less harmful to the global environs while at the same time providing
 sustainable income-generating opportunities for youth .



• Youth in Agribusiness
 AYICC sees agriculture as an essential driver of economic development and an
 area of great opportunity for young people in Africa. The challenge, however,
 is that the growing youth population does not see agriculture as a profitable
 opportunity due to their lack of insight into the opportunities that exist within
 the agriculture value chain. Through our member organizations who are youth
 farmers themselves, AYICC has adopted various strategies including outreach
 to schools and communities, exhibitions and youth agricultural festivals as
 well as institution of award schemes for best youth farmers as a way to raise
 interest and awareness on the opportunities that exist within this sector.

                            products as a by-product of the increasing level of population, affluence, and
                            technological advancement in a given environment or society. In Africa we
                            have witnessed increasing level of pollution from plastic, car tires, bottles
                            among others and this has generated innovative thinking among young
                            people to provide a sustainable solution. Over the years, AYICC members have
                            redefined waste as a resource for sustainable development and through
                            various recycling initiatives, they are bringing life into materials that otherwise
                            could have been a nuisance to the environment.

About Our Campus
The ALA Campus is a beautiful space on the outskirts of Johannesburg.
Since taking occupation 10 years ago and with the generous support of our
donors purchasing the property, we've been investing heavily. We engaged
with a design team with the aim of designing a residential space to house
students and faculty as well as a Library for the Future of Africa.
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS001_ALA","We now have a living document called the ALA's Campus Master Plan,
which is a process and framework for what ALA will be doing with our
learning space over the next 20 years and beyond.

In 2015, we broke ground on the first big project- The newly constructed
residential wings include that form part of the new Nelson Mandela
Residence with 48 Student dorm room, 4 Faculty family home, 10 Faculty
apartments, 2 Large courtyards, 2 Laundry facilities, 4 Shared lounges and
2 Sick bays!

In 2016 we began building The Pardee Learning Commons, the second
construction project on campus, which will redesign and redefine our
learning spaces, positioning ALA as a model for 21st century teaching and
learning.

We have built an online coffee table book that tracks the story and progress
as we build our campus master plan. We highly recommend you visit it,
particularly the timeline and projects sections.



   Below is the virtual tour of our latest campus project the Fred Pardee
                             Learning Commons.




               Below you will find a brief campus tour in photos.

  Home > Apply to ALA > Fees & Financial Assistance




  Fees & Financial
  Assistance
  ALA is one of the most prestigious education institutions in the world, with a
  unique financial model designed to enable us to identify, develop and connect
  Africa's future leaders. Everyone who applies and is then admitted to ALA,
  regardless of financial background or nationality, is eligible to receive significant
  financial assistance* in the form of scholarships and loans towards studying at
  ALA and accessing membership to our lifelong network. The cost of tuition at
  ALA is USD $30,900 per year.

  At ALA, the value of financial awards is determined after admissions decisions
  have been made. Fees charged to a given student will be based on a family's
  financial means. We expect that every family will stretch themselves to finance
  the ALA education, just as we ask ALA's network of supporters from around the
  world to stretch themselves to ensure that every admitted student is able to
  attend. Students from more financially disadvantaged backgrounds receive more
  significant financial assistance from ALA, and families with more resources are
  expected to contribute more to their child's education at ALA.

  Every student will sign the ALA Social Contract - a commitment to contribute to
  peace and prosperity on the continent for at least 10 years in return for the
  financial assistance provided by our community.

Since inception, ALA and our donors have
contributed nearly $50 Million.
The all-inclusive cost of $30,900 per annum to attend ALA includes:

   • All-inclusive for fees for a full year covering tuition, accommodation, sports,
     activities, meals and uniforms.
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS001_ALA","      • Full access to AL.N.s campus facilities including entertainment areas, sports
         fields, high-speed fibre internet, biometric security control.
      • There is proactive health and wellness care, including private medical
         insurance for every student.
      • The Explore Johannesburg program, which gets students out and about in
         our world-class African city, attending cultural and entertainment events.
      • Access to our exclusive and globally renowned University Guidance and
         ""next steps"" team, who will advise ALA families on tertiary study, gap year
         and other options.
      • Exclusive access to the Africa Careers Network, a team at ALA dedicated
         to finding and securing employment for ALA graduates across the continent
         with top employers.

  All financial assistance awards are determined after an in-depth financial needs
  assessment, and require the commitment to the Social Contract. If a student
  breaks their commitment to the social contract, their scholarship will convert into
  an interest bearing loan, such that they create an ALA experience for another
  future African leader.

Executive
Seminars
Executive Seminars
are more intimate
workshops with
smaller groups of
interested students,
covering specialized
subjects. Seminars
are held
approximately once
every two weeks.
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS001_ALA","Topics of Executive
Seminars in the past
have included a
working session on
proposals to the
Global Fund for HIV
run by former
chairperson of the
Global Fund, Wilfred
Griekspoor, a
session on
the Power of
Storytelling, an all-
women panel
on Women in
Entertainment and
Media.

ALA actively
connects its young
leaders to global
platforms such as
the Aspen Institute,
the World Economic
Forum, the Clinton
Global Initiative and
TED, where our
young leaders share
their ideas for
Africa's
transformation and
foster the
connections that will
enable them to
translate vision to
action. Each year,
over 100 students
get to attend
conferences with
renowned leaders in
Africa and around
the world.

Academy seeks to
transform Africa by
developing a
powerful network of
over 6,000 leaders
who will work
together to address
Africa's greatest
challenges, achieve
extraordinary social
impact, and
accelerate the
continent's growth
trajectory.
Africa's greatest
need is ethical and
entrepreneurial
leadership. Too
often, we only invest
in addressing the
symptoms of poor
leadership in Africa:
we give blankets,
food, and medicine
to those impacted
by war, poverty, and
famine. But these
efforts will never
stop unless we
develop leaders who
prevent wars,
entrepreneurs who
create jobs, and
innovators that
develop lasting

solutions to the root
causes of Africa's
problems. We aim to
develop the future
Nelson Mandela, the
next Wangari
Maathai, and the
African Bill Gates.

     INTRODUCTION TO THE ALA SOCIAL CONTRACT AND FORGIVABLE LOAN

Introduction
The following memo is a guide to your financial assistance award. After reading this memo you should have clarity
and understanding of:

    1.   Our Guiding Principles
    2.   What the ALA Social Contract is
    3.   What your ALA tuition fees entail
    4.   What the terms of the financial assistance agreement mean
    5.   What the deferment process entails
    6.   Who to contact should you have comments or queries


1. Our Guiding Principles

At African Leadership Academy, we believe that financial circumstances should not impede a student from reaching
their full potential, and should not rob Africa of its most promising talent. When we admitted you to ALA, we made
a statement about our belief in your potential to transform the continent, and about our commitment to empower
you on your leadership journey.

If you and your family cannot afford or independently finance your education at ALA, we have, through the
generosity of our donors, made institutional loans available to you. Our loans, unlike almost any other loan you may
seek, are forgivable if you meet the terms of your financial assistance agreement, because our loans are a social
contract between you and the entire ALA community.

2. The ALA Social Contract

A social contract is an agreement for mutual benefit between an individual or group and the government, an
organisation or community as a whole. At ALA, donors, parents, students, alumni, and staffulty come together to
support ALA’s mission to promote lasting peace and shared prosperity on the African continent. We do this by
identifying, developing, and connecting the next generation of African leaders. Under ALA’s model, students’
financial circumstances are not considered during the admissions process (we have “need-blind admissions”), and all
admitted students can receive need-based financial assistance in the form of a forgivable loan to ensure they can
attend the Academy.

The ALA forgivable loan agreement is a social contract entered into between the incoming student and the entire
ALA community. The members of our community have come, and continue to come together, in order to develop
leaders for the continent. Therefore, the loan is forgiven for the alumni that return to have impact on the continent
for at least 10 years after their 25th birthday (or from the moment they complete their undergraduate degree,
whichever comes first).

ALA is not expecting you to fulfil your part of the social contract on your own. We have made a lifelong
commitment to the development of your career, and have established the Department of Lifelong Engagement to
assist you in your career development.

3. What Your Tuition Fees Entail

The total cost of attending ALA is split between your student contribution and your proposed ALA financial
assistance award. You will pay your contribution to fees during your time on campus at ALA, per the payment

structure provided by ALA Finance. If you choose to accept our financial assistance award, ALA will cover the
difference between your expected student contribution and ALA’s full tuition through a financial assistance award.
Our financial assistance award is an option for you, not an obligation. You must let us know if you choose to accept
it, or if you will find other means to cover the gap between your expected student contribution and ALA’s full
tuition.

If you choose to accept ALA’s financial assistance please read below to understand the terms of your Financial
Assistance Agreement.

Please note that financial assistance is optional, therefore this section may not be applicable to all students

4. Understanding Key Terms in Your Financial Assistance Award Agreement

During the Admissions process of enrolment at ALA, you will sign two key documents, namely:

     1. The ALA Enrolment Contract; and
     2. ALA Financial Assistance Award Agreement (Optional)


The ALA Financial Assistance Award Agreement contains key terms which require thorough understanding. Below
is a summary of the key terms and their interpretations:

Forgivable Loan

A forgivable loan is a form of a loan in which its entirety, or a portion of it, can be forgiven by the lender when
certain conditions are met. However, if the conditions are not met, the loan has to be repaid, usually with interest.
ALA’s financial assistance is structured this way to honour the promise under which ALA’s past and present donors
chose to support ALA, namely, to develop leaders who will develop the African continent. The interpretation of this
statement has been, and continues to be, that our young leaders will have the most impact on the continent by being
present on the continent. Therefore, the loan is forgivable on condition of your physical return and residence on the
continent.


3.2 Establish residence and employment in Africa for a period of 10 years

The interpretation of ‘employment’ has been broadened to mean ‘reside in Africa’. This means that as long as you
are physically present on the African continent, ALA will assume your residence to also mean you are positively
contributing economically and socially to the African continent. Entrepreneurial ventures, part-time or full-time
employment, pursuing any post-graduate education – (such as graduate school, a second degree, a PhD, etc.) will
also count to fulfil the terms of your contract. Your mere presence in Africa is enough. Please note that the
abovementioned examples are not exhaustive.

You are required to be physically present on the African continent for a minimum of 10 years to qualify for the full
loan forgiveness. Every year you spend on the African continent after your undergraduate degree counts toward
forgiveness. 1/10th of your loan will be forgiven every year you spend on the African continent, meaning that by the
end of the 10th year, your loan will be fully forgiven.

Please note that as a general rule, any time spent on the African continent prior to age 25 or before completing your
undergraduate degree will not count towards forgiveness. Gap years, starting a venture before (or instead of going
to) college, complete internships, etc., may be considered towards your Return To Africa commitment on a case-by-
case basis.

3.3 Principal amount and accrued interest

Principal Amount: The original loan amount borrowed.

Accrued Interest: The growing amount charged by the lender (ALA) to a borrower (the student) for the cost of
borrowing.



3.4 [Interest is] compounded annually

Compounded interest arises when interest is added to the principal amount of a loan, so that the interest that has
been added to the loan also accrues interest. In a way, compounded interest can be thought of as “interest on
interest,” and can be contrasted with simple interest, which is interest calculated only on the principal loan amount.

Your financial assistance loan begins accruing interest immediately after your studies at ALA begin and continues to
do so until the loan is forgiven or paid in full. The interest rate for your loan is set at 18% per year.


5. Applying for Deferment

Should you wish to postpone your return to the African continent after your 25th birthday, you have the option of
deferment available to you. A deferment allows you to choose to postpone repayment on your loan for a specified
period for residency reasons.
You may choose deferment in the following instances:
     Further education
     Job/Research opportunities which are unavailable or rare on the African continent
     Job/Research opportunities which will uniquely prepare you for your career on the African continent
     Job/Research opportunities whose impact has a strong and direct link to the development of the African
        continent
     Unforeseen circumstances such as: unemployment on the African continent, personal and/or extenuating
        circumstances

Please note: the abovementioned examples are not exhaustive. Deferment will be granted on a case by case basis.

The interest on the loan will continue to accrue during the deferment period. You must apply for deferment if you
are planning to reside out of Africa (for any reason) after your 25th birthday. To apply for deferment, you will need
to submit a deferment application form, motivational letter and additional documentation (where required) to
studentloans@africanleadershipacademy.org. A panel will then review your application, and provide your results
within 3 weeks.

 6. Accessing Your Loan Details
The ALA Finance Office will inform you about your loan details via annual statements. Alternatively, you may
contact the ALA Finance Office via email at studentloans@africanleadershipacademy.org for any loan-related
queries you may have.

   ALUMNI NETWORK CAPE TOWN
          REJUVENATED
 Cape Town- on the 31 st January at the launch of Young Urban Women and
 Men Conference with over 100 young people engaging on real and health
                        issues surrounding young people.


 Our Alumni Network has now grown to over 2,500 members across South
 Africa.   Luzuko Mabhongo, Assistance            Facilitator and Alumni          Network
 Coordinator at Zolile Malindi Centre in Mfuleni, is a graduate of our Career

exciting,"" says Luzuko. ""Especially in 2019 with so many great memories, such
as the Annual Business Summit that had two winners from Cape Town.""

The growth of the Network in Cape Town hasn't been easy, particularly given
their spatial distance from the Alumni headquarters in Johannesburg.
However, the members remained focused and committed and together with
support from colleagues such as Nehwoh Belinda and Warren Radebe, they
were able to create and sustain a vibrant and engaging Alumni community.
Luzuko is particularly grateful for the comradery on the annual Alumni Day,
where all members get an opportunity to network and catch up.

The Young Urban Men and Women programmes remain a favourite as it
provides a safe space for both genders to engage on issues relating to, among
other things, youth sexual and reproductive health. This year, members faced
an unexpected challenge as a result of Covid-19, but are continuing to give
back to the community, help others to stay safe and engage as a network.

an opportunity to gain experience in working with young people.

With Covid-19 affecting my community, I had to change my plans and adjust to
new expenses like higher data usage to do my school work. This sometimes
limits me. Thanks to the YES4YOUTH modules about approaching new
challenges, I have learned a lot about myself - such as what I am capable of,
the importance of saving money and how to spend it wisely.""

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS004_AfrikaTikkun","The Bertie Lubner Legacy Week continues to inspire young people to follow in the
footsteps of this philanthropic giant, whose legacy still echoes in our hearts. Once
again, the Alumni Network organized vibrant and educational events at all our
centres.

We had over 100 volunteers eager to give their time to local organizations and
schools participating in the Legacy Week. Among these were Childline, Autism
South Africa and lthlokomeleng Old Age Home.

As is the custom, the week kicked off with the launch of the Legacy Museums,
curated exhibitions of the life and times of Bertie Lubner. This served as an
important reminder of the difficult social context within which Bertie Lubner
sought to make change. It's no wonder his incredible achievements continue to
motivate our young people. This year, our members got busy with community
service, painting, cleaning the centres and preparing food for our elderly.

The entire week was an unforgettable movement, providing an opportunity for our
members to give back in the spirit of responsible kindness.

HISTORY OF AFRIKA
TIKKUN
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS004_AfrikaTikkun","We were founded in 1994 by the late Chief Rabbi Cyril Harris and
Philanthropist/Businessman Dr Bertie Lubner. Initially, the day to day
needs of children was a priority but soon after, the organisation
evolved into one focused on overall development. Renamed
MaAfrika Tikkun and later Afrika Tikkun, our approach was refined
and reformulated into the Cradle to Career 360° model. This Model is
aimed at providing education, health and social services to young
people and their families through centres of excellence in South
African townships. Our main goal is to create a sustainable future for
the youth of South Africa and the credibility of this cause won the
support of the organisations Patron-in-Chief in memoriam, Nelson
Mandela. Since then, we have built 4 centres of excellence across
Gauteng and 1 in the Western Cape.

The primary objective of Afrika Tikkun is to provide holistic development i1
disadvantaged communities. We aim to empower young people by affording then
the opportunity to receive gainful education, good health care, nutrition ani
support for their families. In doing so, we equalise the playing field for unprivilegec
young people so that they have the same employment opportunities that privilege<
youth have. We offer a number of programmes that ensure an all rounded perso1
as the outcome. Our 360 degree Model of care consists of three programmei
namely: Early Childhood Development, Child and Youth Development, and Caree
Development. Additionally, we have programmes which support our 360 degre1
Model, namely: Family Support Services, Primary Health Care, The Empowermen

                     Over the last 25 years, Afrika Tikkun’s vision has been to enable the economic
                     empowerment of South African young people by tackling the socio-economic drivers
                     that make it difficult for them to break away from the cycle of poverty.

                  original Patrons. They were not only supportive to Afrika
                  Tikkun, but visited the Centres and gave of their love to the
                  Afrika Tikkun team. The Ronnie and Rhona Lubner Centre in

                  In conclusion, I must acknowledge one of the finest groups
                  of executives that I have ever had the privilege of working
                  with. Their commitment, late nights and long hours
                  (including over weekends), reflects a passion for excellence
                  that is noteworthy. My team have learnt to complement
                  one another and take initiative, displaying a drive that most
                  CEO’s can only dream of. It has been my honour to lead a
                  team dedicated to responsible kindness expressed in their
                  work and social lives.

                 at supporters homes in New York and Philadelphia. In April our four chosen young people from

                   The primary objective of Afrika Tikkun is therefore to reduce youth unemployment and child poverty in South

                              SINDI SHINES WITH TLC
                 Sindi is 5 years old and lives with her mother and 3 siblings
                 near the Mfuleni centre. She was diagnosed with a lung
                 condition that causes her to use a breathing aid 24/7. When
                 Sindi joined our ECD programme, Empowerment case
                 administrators encouraged the family to join the support
                 group for parents of children with disabilities.




                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       29
                 Sindi’s first months in the programme were tough as she
                 was overly hyperactive and disrupted the class often. Her
                 hyperactivity meant that her breathing aid needed to be
                 cleaned continuously.

                 Her teachers encouraged her to focus her energy on
                 creative art, painting and puzzles. With the aid of Lego
                 Blocks and daily reading, they slowly began to develop
                 her cognitive skills. Additionally, Sindi’s breathing aid was
                 cleaned regularly to improve her lung condition.

                 Through the combined efforts of the ECD teachers,
                 Empowerment case workers and Primary Health Care
                 workers, Sindi has been doing well in her daily activities                                                                       After months of continuous support and
                 and has not had any issues regarding breathing.
                                                                                                                                                  development, Sindi no longer needs to use a

                      neighbouring community. At this time, I was 19 and doing my

                      matric, my mother sat me down and told me that I could be
                                                                                                                                                       the next 10 years, I would like to have completed a BTech
                      whomever I wanted to be, but it won’t be easy.
                                                                                                                                                       Degree in IT.
                      In 2011, I passed matric with a bachelor’s, which made my
                      mother proud. I had never seen my family so happy, maybe
                      it’s because I’m the eldest of my siblings. The following three
                      years I was in and out of jobs, which was extremely frustrating.
                      I knew the solution was to enrol for a course that would
                      help me develop myself. I attended college thinking I was
                      on the right track but I became friends with people who had
                      a negative impact on my life. I stopped attending classes and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * not his real name

                      Lulama*, a 15-year-old girl was born HIV-positive. Her younger brother, Sipho* is
                      9 years old and they both attend primary school. Three years ago, Lulama’s HIV-
                      positive mother fell ill. She was in and out of hospital before she finally passed away.
                      The children were left without a caregiver. During that time, Lulama stopped taking
                      her medication and was admitted to hospital. She lost a lot of weight and her diet
                      was very poor, affecting her attendance and performance at school. The children
                      were referred to Afrika Tikkun.

                      Through Afrika Tikkun’s intervention, the children’s maternal uncle decided to
                      take them in. Afrika Tikkun equipped the uncle and his wife with parenting skills,

                      knowing that they had to take care of two children of their own. “We also supported
                      the family with food parcels and other donations. We made sure Lulama was taking
                      her treatment. We also taught the aunt how to care for a child with HIV”.

                      Lulama attends Afrika Tikkun every day – where she receives a healthy meal and
                      plenty of emotional and academic support. In recognition of how much she has
                      progressed and matured, she was selected to attend a leadership camp.

                      “I learnt a lot from that experience. I really appreciate what Afrika Tikkun has done for my family and me”,
                      she says. She is now taking her medication and is on a healthy diet. She is a healthy and happy child. Her
                      class teacher also reports that she is doing well at school.

                      OF GERMANY
                      I thought I was dreaming and never took it seriously until I
                      saw myself at the airport saying goodbye to my family and
                      friends.

                        Here it comes, a scary moment, the dream and all the
50




                      happiness flashes away and is replaced by fear of the
                      unknown. I got on the plane, and realised there was nothing
                      to be afraid of. We arrived in Dusseldorf and met two
                      fantastic mothers who took us for a tour.

                      There were many beautiful places we visited. I could spend
                      the whole day sharing how fun it was.

                      Everyone I met there was great, generous and welcoming.
                      This experience has really changed my life for the better, I
                      saw that the world is big enough for me to reach my dreams
                      and dream beyond Diepsloot.

                      I would like to thank all the people who have contributed to
                      our visit. I am grateful for their time, financial - and any other
                      support.

                 My name is Sibongile, and I was fortunate enough to go to
                 the USA on the 3rd – 30th of April. The first day of traveling
                 was overwhelming, it was my first time being at the airport
                 and my very first time seeing a plane. That day Sipho took
                 us to Mug n’ Bean before our flight, which was also my first

                 being in such an expensive restaurant. When I boarded
                 the plane my heart thumped with excitement, and when it
                 started moving I felt as if I was on a carnival ride. After we
                 landed in Boston our hosts took us to go watch a baseball
                 match and at the end of the game, they bought us Redsoxx
                 sweaters, gloves and hats.

                 After the game we went to watch the Boston marathon
                 and then bowling, were we spent a day having fun with the
                 members of the junior board. One of my highlights was going
                 to Harvard University and going to Bobby Sager’s house.                                                                          I really enjoyed the trip and I have learnt a lot from a lot of

                 tried a lot of things like fried pickles. During our stay in Las
                 Vegas we participated in the Safelite marathon. The next day                                                                     Sibongile
                 we went to Columbus Ohio where we went to the Safelite

beyond language. Since the young competitors
are required to spell words, while on stage, they
develop self-confidence, communication and
public speaking skills and the ability to thrive
under pressure.

                       corruption and state capture scandals                                                                                      collapse. On the contrary, Afrika Tikkun since its

 Emerging Leaders Foundation

It is often a challenge, especially in the African context, to talk about one's
accomplishments without appearing to be too proud or self-centred. But when
the whole continent recognizes your work, remaining silent might be too rude a
response to give.


Emerging Leaders Foundation was feted with the African Impact Award on the
16th of August 2019 at the National Museums of Kenya by the Voice Achievers
Award.


This award is in recognition of our work over the last seven years, during this
time, we have trained well over 20,000 young leaders in Kenya spread over 29
counties.


Leadership is pegged on the ability to influence; individuals, families,
organizations, communities and even nations. Everything, we believe, rises and
falls on leadership. That is why at ELF we are obsessed with adding tools to the
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS045EmergingLeadersFoundation","toolbox of young emerging leaders to prepare them for sustainable development
of their societies.


Our alumni have proceeded to become productive members of society,
championing for communities where people live with dignity and leadership is
values based.


Take a walk from Kilifi County where you will find our alumni involved in their
communities through activities like sports for change. You will find them in
Mombasa advocating for financial integrity in the county. In Makueni and
Murang'a they will be the ones mobilising fellow youth around issues and
promoting entrepreneursh ip for livelihood. They will be running for student
leadership positions in different universities and institutions of learning here in
Nairobi and beyond. In Narok and Migori, our alumni are championing for an end
to early marriage and FGM, and promoting the education girls in those counties.


In short, we have successfully invaded all the spheres of our society with the
contagious flu of values-based leadership which is proactive and transformative.
This award fans to flame our passion for the youth of Africa, besides rubber
stamping our place on the global map as the leading African organization on
matters youth leadership development and mentorship.


The Voice Achievers Award is a project of The Voice magazine and recognizes
Africans and friends of Africa for outstanding achievement on a yearly basis.
Among prominent Africans honoured by The Voice in the past are Dr. Kenneth
Kaunda, former President of Zambia, President Dr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President
of the Republic of Sierra Leone, Mrs. Fatou Bensouda, The Chief Persecutor of the
International Criminal Court (ICC), Ms. Miet Smet - President European
Parliamentarians for Africa, Apostle Hayford lkponmwosa Alike (OFR),
outstanding African diplomats and many more.


Thank you, Voice Magazine, for amplifying our voices and thank you Africa for
noticing our local contributions at a global arena.

LEADERS
ELF is in the business of identifying
polishing and supporting Africa's Young
                                                                     V
leaders. We prepare them to shape the
future of the continent through our three-
step model: Self Discovery, People
Connection, Community Impact.



Discover
Leaders must first discover and know who they are before embarking on making any
change in their communities. We guide participants in reflecting and articulating
narratives from their personal life journeys. Each leader in the program is tutored on
how to use the powerful art of storytelling to share the truths from triumphs and failures
that continue to shape their lives.

""We have to dare to be ourselves, however frightening or strange
that self may prove to be."" -   May Sarton

Connect
Establishing a connection with people is the first step to having influence in many
communities. We impart our young leaders with the fundamental skills for a good first
impression and developing an authentic connection when working with their target
constituency.
""We are all different. Don't judge, understand instead."" - Roy T Bennett

Impact
Leadership is about results. It's about making a real tangible difference in the lives of
communities. ELF works in partnership with organizations to offer internships,
exchange programs and work opportunities for the leaders in the making to start on
their impact journey.

ABOUT CHANGAMKA FELLOWSHIP
In a series of pre-election engagements of young people in Kenya's 2017 elections,
IFES Kenya through its IFES-GAC program proved that beyond developing avenues
and platforms of participation and interest among young people in the electoral, public
and political spaces; there was among other needs the want for structured mentorship
sessions on various topics among them self-development and economic
empowerment and impacting their communities.

It is upon this premise that IFES Kenya under the IFES-GAC program partnered with
Emerging Leaders Foundation (ELF), Emerging Leaders Foundation (ELF) - a
Leadership training, mentorship and coaching platform that concerns itself with
growing the next generation of value-driven and sufficiently tooled leaders for
transformative change in communities throughout the Global South.

ELF got into a contract with IFES Kenya on this program to mentor a group of 40
select young people aged between 18 and 30 years' old who had been part of a bigger
group dubbed the Campus Ambassadors.

 Emerging Leaders Foundation (ELF)

Emerging Leaders Foundation (ELF) is an African youth centered non-profit
organization that provides practical, values-based leadership development,
mentorship, governance and livelihoods training to promising young Africans,
so that they can become positive agents of sustainable social, economic and
political transformation in society. ELF exists to increase the participation of
young men and women in governance and policy processes in order to promote
dignity in society through increased accountability and service delivery on the
part of duty bearers. We believe that when youth are equipped with the relevant
knowledge, skills, and competencies, they begin to participate more strategically
and productively in leadership and governance processes.



OUR STORY
ELF was started in 2012 in Kenya to reach out to young people between 15 - 35
years, to help them discover their purpose, utilize their potential and become the
best they can be in life. In Kenya just like in other African countries, young people
account for more than 50 per cent of the total population.


As an organization, we believe that young people are the best resource that any
nation has to be able to sustain growth and prosperity. At the moment the reality
is that majority of young people in Kenya and Africa at large are in the periphery
of decision making and policy processes.
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS045EmergingLeadersFoundation","WHO WEARE
ELF is a leadership cradle that nurtures young African men and women with the
potential and promise of championing for positive change at the grassroots level.


We provide a platform for young people to reach inside for something bigger to
live for, and to thirst for knowledge and skills necessary to function optimally. We
encourage them to dream of a better world for all humanity starting with the
communities they call home.



OUR TEAM
The ELF core team consists of knowledgeable and experienced professionals
committed to all-rounded development of youth. They bring with them a wealth
of experience in organizational development, self-development, mentorship,
leadership, effective participation in governance, fundraising, grants
management, politics, gender perspectives, advocacy and capacity building.
The combined team expertise includes youth development, program assessment
and implementation, group work, behavior management, coaching, mentorship,
facilitation, curriculum development, leadership development and sustainable
development.

        changamka programme and one of
        the Tunaweza Fellow from Narok

had to drop out of school for 3 years...”

HIGHLIGHTS


  Having successfully done phase one of this project last year which culminated in the
  National Youth and Devolution Symposium in June 2018 which brought together about
  300 youth at the Kenya School of Government to discuss the place of young people in
  the devolution process, at the end of the symposium a position paper was presented to
  government (State department for youth affairs).

  FORD Foundation supported the scaling up of this project to four more counties (Kilifi,
  Makueni, Murang’a and Narok) in addition to the initial four counties (Uasin Gishu,
  Kericho, Migori and Bungoma).
                                                                       Page 1
  We successfully did a round of capacity building sessions from Kilifi to Bungoma form-
  ing
  a team of 15 champions of transparency and accountability in each of the counties.
  We are now in the process of planning for the 2nd Youth and Devolution Symposium
  in May to bring together all the participating counties in this project and invite all the
  other counties to come and learn and share information on how to position youth at the
  heart
  of devolution.

  We will later on have an exchange program between the participating counties to
  enhance learning and sharing and also to build a team of good governance champions
  who are networked across the country.

    I have learnt to embrace rejection, that when I received an acceptance mail
    from Emerging Leaders Foundation, I decided to make the most of this fellow-
    ship.

    An eighteen-year-old girl goes to the clinic, accompanied by her first boy-
    friend, to treat what seemed like an STI. Nothing could have prepared her
    from the revelation. I tested positive for pregnancy, had an STI and turned out
    to be HIV positive. My dreams of pursuing education went down the drain. I
    remember going to the University of Nairobi to apply for the joint admissions
    board, given that I had scored a B-; and stood a chance of getting into the sys-
    tem. I never followed it through. I had a lot going on.

  DEVOLUTION SYMPOSIUM, HELD ON 12TH AND 13th JUNE, 2019, AT AFRICA
  INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY, KAREN , NAIROBI


  A total of 300 youth delegates drawn from all the 47 counties of the Republic of Kenya,
  attended a 2-day meeting, dubbed the ‘2nd National Youth and Devolution Symposium’
  convened by Emerging Leaders Foundation (ELF). The symposium, whose theme was
  ‘Positioning the Youth at the Heart of Devolution’ was a culmination of work that ELF
  has been doing in 8 counties (Kilifi, Makueni, Murangá, Narok, Uasin Gishu, Bungoma,
  Migori and Kericho), working specifically to strengthen the capacity of youth in terms of
  how they engage their respective county governments.


  The over-arching objective of the symposium was for the youth drawn from across the
  country to reflect on the progress made in attaining the youth agenda through devolution,
  discuss the pitfalls and explore other emergent issues and opportunities, going forward.


  Overall, the participants noted that:
1. Kenya has an enabling policy, legal, institutional and constitutional framework that
   provides opportunities for realization and implementation of the youth agenda, in a
   manner that fulfils their aspirations. However, all these opportunities are impeded by
   rampant corruption and wanton theft of public resources in both the county and national
   level.
2. Emerging Leaders Foundation, together with other youth serving organizations in the
   non-state actors’ group, have played a significant role in supporting youth initiatives,

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS045EmergingLeadersFoundation","   giving prominence to the youth agenda, inculcating regard to the national values and
   enabling youth to realize socio-economic and political aspirations.


3. Devolution remains a pivotal platform on which youth can prosecute their agenda in a
   manner that is constructive, progressive and sustainable.

4. Statutory, periodic elections offer an opportunity for youths to access positions of power
   and exert their influence in championing youth related issues, both at the National and
   County Assemblies.

5. The Access to Government Procurement Opportunities (AGPO) program, if implemented
   as it should, is a progressive intervention for socio-economic empowerment of the youth
   in the country.

6. Depression and extreme gambling among the youth are the emerging vices in the country
   that need urgent government action at both national and county level.


   Going forward, the delegates agreed that:


1. Devolution is still a work in progress, with multiple loopholes both in law and
   implementation. Its success is hinged, in part, on robust public participation, especially
   from the youths
2. The National Government’s Big Four Agenda offers a defined avenue through which
   youth can deepen their participation in devolution, especially in view of the ongoing plans
   to align these 4 sectors (manufacturing, job creation, universal health and affordable
   housing) with the developmental plans of the devolved units.


3. Politics and hero-leadership has taken undue status in the country. Political competition
   has taken precedence over development planning.

4. Oversight in the county governments has been marred with multi-layered conflicts of
   interest by players.

   forge, at the county level, to consolidate their agenda, expand their platform and amplify
   their voice as a united front.



   Finally, the delegates recommended that:


1. For effective promotion of youth development projects, county governments in
   partnership with all stakeholders should make deliberate efforts to develop youth-centred
   development programmes informed by an all-inclusive consultative process.
2. The Ministry of Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs, through the State Department
   of Youth needs to harness youth-serving efforts at all levels of National and County
   government to leverage on available platforms for young people. This can be achieved
   through an inter-agency for information sharing and programme coordination.
3. All county governments take up open tender systems to weed out institutionalised
   corruption in that sector.


4. There is need for county governments to increase responsiveness to youth issues, not only
   in policy articulation in the CIPDs, but also through budgetary allocations and visible,
   auditable projects.


5. All youth across the country ought to support the government’s renewed war on
   corruption, which has had pervasive effects on youths by curtailing their participation in
   governance and access to government services.


6. All youth ought to embrace a value-driven life especially those in positions of
   responsibility. This is, in many ways, the anchor of good governance.

7. Individuals and institutions working within youth spaces especially at the county level,
   should seek to build networks, eliminate silo mentality and define common issues that
   they can pursue collectively.

       from devolution, a lot more needs to be done in adjusting the current policy, legal,
       regulatory and institutional framework to respond to emerging realities on youth issues.
       The approval of the Draft National Youth Policy needs to be expedited by the Cabinet.


Overall, it is our aspiration that more partners, both state and non-state, will work together, to
continue bringing youth and youth-led organizations, at the center of policy making within their
respective counties.


Ahead of the 3rd Youth and Devolution Symposium in 2019, we expect to see the following,
among other things:
      Increased public awareness of the role of youth in implementation of devolution in
       Kenya. Specifically, deepening their awareness of the opportunity to take part in policy
       and decision-making in their respective counties.
      Constructive engagement and influence of youth in the devolved functions
      Strengthened capacity and role of youth and local organizations in implementation of
       devolution.
      Strengthened accountability mechanisms for youth actors in the devolution space.

Ratification of the Position Paper:
The participants unanimously agreed with the contents of this position paper, and by motion, the
following two delegates ratified it on behalf of the other participants:
   1. Ms. Winnie Mukosi – Delegate, Makueni County
   2. Mr. Ken Ruto – Delegate, Uasin Gishu County

Alumni associations
As a Commonwealth Alumnus, we encourage you to join a local alumni association in your home country, or in the country in which
you are currently living or working.

Our alumni associations are coordinated by alumni volunteers who are responsible for organising a range of local events and
activities which encourage networking and ongoing professional development. In certain countries, alumni associations are
supported by the British Council (on behalf of the CSC), which assists in establishing and strengthening these groups.

All CSC alumni events are advertised on our Calendar. If you do not receive an invite to an event happening near you, please
contact us at alumni@cscuk.org.uk

Each alumni association is different, from the types of events they organise to their membership requirements. A list of current
alumni associations and contact information can be found below.

The CSC is not responsible for the content of external sites or the operation of alumni associations.

Call for volunteers
If your country is not listed below, then an alumni association has not yet been set up. If you are interested in volunteering to
coordinate an association, or organising a local event to re-connect with fellow alumni , please get in touch with us at
alumni@cscuk.org.uk

Development Training Programme 2019-2020
Background


Development Training is a key part of the Commonwealth Scholarship award. The CSC aims to equip
Commonwealth Scholars with the skills to effect real development impact on their return home, as well as
to create a community of motivated Commonwealth Scholars through an extensive programme of training
and networking.


CSC Virtual Engagement Programme


With the unfolding Covid-19 crisis in the UK, the CSC took the decision in mid-March to cancel all planned
face to face events for the rest of the academic year to safeguard the health and wellbeing of our Scholars
and staff involved in delivering these events, and to comply with Government guidance. Since then we
have been looking into alternative ways of ensuring Scholars and alumni can continue to network and
engage with each other through our events and training, and therefore we are pleased to announce the
start of our Virtual Engagement Programme of events, activities and training for 2020.


Our first virtual site visit chats took place in May with Scholars based at Liverpool Hope University,
Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the University of Liverpool.
We have also hosted virtual site visits with Scholars based in Wales, Bath, London and Leeds.


With further virtual site visits planned in June and July, we hope you will be able to join CSC staff and
fellow Scholars at one of these informal meetups soon. Please see the list of proposed virtual site visits
below.

Joan Lydia Mbeyu

                                       After completing her BSc in Economics and Statistics from Kenyatta University, Kenya, Joan briefly
                                       worked for Kenya Airways before branching to Research and Development and ended up working as a
                                       researcher for World Agroforestry Center-lCRAF in Nairobi. It is at ICRAF where her interest in
                                        sustainable development developed. She now works towards combining business cases, environmental
                                       rationale and social logic to address the selfishness and apathy of the ones responsible of managing
                                       different ecosystems.

                                       Joan's research interests lie in climate change adaptation and mitigation, which includes the development
of mechanisms and formulation of legislative which will back up the integration of development goals and environmental
imperatives. Her objective is to acquire science-based knowledge on environmental systems which will assist her to contribute
adjustments to variability in climate and long-term changes through various mitigation and adaptation solutions at local, national
and international levels.

                                             Technology, Ghana. He is currently a doctoral candidate at the Central University of Technology, Free
                                             State. His research is in campus sustainability, specifically the use of solar photovoltaic in promoting
                                             green buildings at universities.

                                             Nutifafa believes that action speaks louder than words, and that what wings are to a bird is what
                                             education is to those who receive it. For this reason, he founded T-Action Global, an organisation
                                             which awards scholarships, promotes third party scholarship opportunities, and provides support and
                                             guidance to scholarship applicants, as a means of giving back to his community.

As the Knowledge Hub Coordinator (Alumni) of the climate change resilience and mitigation hub, Nutifafa hopes to facilitate
discussions and exchange ideas among Commonwealth Scholars to advance action towards addressing the causes and impacts
of climate change.

Nutifafa is a 2011 Shared Scholar from Ghana. He completed an MSc Environmental Management at Liverpool Hope University.

AYLS93_0verview I Commonwealth Scholarship

Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in the
UK
The CSC's evaluation and monitoring (E&M) programme aims to:
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS093_CommonwealthScholarship","   • Monitor the experiences, satisfaction, and performance of Commonwealth Scholars and Fellows
   • Identify and measure the outcomes and impact of Commonwealth Scholarships and Fellowships on
      individuals, institutions, and communities and societies
   • Contribute to the CSC's learning processes and inform strategic and operational decision-making
   • Strengthen accountability and communicate outcomes to award holders, funders, and other
      stakeholders
The E&M programme is coordinated by a team at the CSC Secretariat and overseen by the CSC's Evaluation
and Monitoring Committee.



Approach




The CSC uses a variety of methods to gather evidence relating to the outcomes and impact of its eight
scholarship schemes. In particular, we aim to track individual trajectories to determine personal award
outcomes, as well as exploring the cumulative impact of awards on wider socioeconomic development.


Surveys
Each year we send out surveys to incoming Commonwealth Scholars and Fellows and alumni to gather
information about their pre- and post-scholarship/fellowship careers. From alumni, we collect details on
the knowledge and skills that they gained during their award, and their ability to apply these skills in the
workplace after returning home. We also ask for details of their activities, and the impact they are having in
key development sectors.


We are also interested in the experiences and views of other stakeholders and partners; we survey hosts,
employers, and overseas nominating agencies. We also undertake ad hoc survey exercises.


Findings from these surveys are reported to the CSC's E&M Committee and the wider Commission, and are
also P-Ublished for wider dissemination.




Interviews and focus group discussions

interviews and focus group discussions. These activities enable us to gain an in-depth understanding of the
successes of our alumni and the challenges that they face in their careers, as well as providing a wealth of
rich information about wider outcomes and impact.


As with surveys, the E&M team has also initiated interviews and focus groups with hosts and supervisors, in
order to better understand their experiences of the programme and to document its benefits to UK
universities and host organisations.



Developing new tools and methods
Over the past ten years, the E&M programme has developed and refined its methods, building on an initial
(essential) tracing and survey exercise. We have experimented with counterfactual approaches, aligned
data collection tools across programmes to allow for future comparative review, and developed a new
longitudinal survey methodology. Upcoming priorities include building on existing qualitative work, and
developing new and improved means of publishing and disseminating our findings.



Scholarship evaluation: collaborating with others
The CSC is continually striving to improve its approach to scholarship evaluation. As well as attending
relevant workshops, seminars, and other events within the evaluation and higher education sectors, the
E&M team works closely with external colleagues in the UK and overseas to share experiences and
knowledge wherever possible. In addition to our own P-Ublications, we work with the Association of
Commonwealth Universities to curate the 'Measuring Success?' blog series, featuring contributions from
colleagues throughout the sector discussing their experiences of analysing the outcomes of scholarships
and of evidence-informed policymaking.

Imagine the KECTIL Generation ••••


We are youth not defined by the year we were born. We are defined by our focus on a
future that demands our attention. We are the youth leaders of Developing Countries.
Toe:ether as a e:lobal team we are called to chane:e our communities for the better. And
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS136_KectilGeneration","we have the strength to do it.

Positive.

   1. Positivity begins with ourselves. Self-confidence starts by finding our inner strength. This inner
     strength makes us ready to change the world around us.
   2. We train our minds by learning as much as possible about the world we live in. We read and study
     purposefully. We look at all angles and consider all views with respect. We absorb information and
     then check it for accuracy or bias.
   3. We are honest and reliable.
   4. We treat everyone with kindness and compassion, especially when we disagree.
   5. We are positive role models for both the old and the young.
   6. We each contribute our own special skills to the goal and look for others who can contribute as
     well. It is together that we form the necessary whole.
   7. We abide by the Kectil Code to equally respect everyone regardless of nationality, religion, culture,
     ethnicity or gender.
   8. We know we will be successful because we have to be. We will not settle for less.

Change.

   1. We demand good honest government.
   2. We reject and expose corruption. Corruption has devastating effects on Youth and it has to stop.
   3. We, as Males being Promise Leaders and Females also doing their part, will support and encourage
     each other's well-being through respect and encouragement.
   4. We fight for the improvement of our environment, from small tasks such as picking up garbage, to
     living a sustainable lifestyle to tackling large waste projects.
   5. We acknowledge the problem of overpopulation and disproportionate growth in developing
     countries, and we study its projected effects on our future.
   6. We innovate and create using the best of our talents to improve the quality of life.
   7. We strongly reject prejudices and hatred based on nationality, religion, culture, ethnicities, social
     position and gender, which have been imposed on us. We accept everyone and expect the same
     from them.
   8. We reach out to youth in other countries to create the global network for change. We commit to
     forming life-long unbreakable bonds. And we commit our support.

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS136_KectilGeneration","We are adding another 1000 to our previously reached goal of 1000!

In 2019, Kectil launched an initiative called ""1000 Males Campaign"" on its website. We challenged males
to stand up to a large leadership role to protect females in their societies.
We successfully met the goal with 1000 Male Pledges from more than 72 countries in the world! That is a
big milestone for us, and we are so proud to receive messages from Promise Keepers saying how they
have been keeping their promises after pledging a year ago.
We publicly honor those males who participated and acted as they promised! We have set a new goal
where those who have already pledged can promise again while still inviting others to join!

2000 Male Promise Keepers!!

The Malmar Knowles Family Foundation and The Kectil Program are excited to announce that the male
pledges portal is now reopened! In 2019, we successfully reached the goal of attaining 1000 pledges with
the support of 1000 brave males from 72 countries. We have been motivated to take this legacy up a
notch by launching the ""2000 Males Campaign"". Yes, we have decided to double the goal!
With more males involved in protecting females, the communities will indefinitely get better for
everyone. With that belief, we ask men to stand up and act as ""Promise Keepers"" to take care of the girls
and women in their society, to profess their commitment to the females at large, and to protect females
against any forms of violence.
We call for males to take the following pledge:
1. When you see a female you find atractive, you must ask yourself this VERY important question. ""If I am
with this female and she gets pregnant, would I be willing to take care of her and the baby with a full
commitment?"" If the answer is no, then put your hands in your pocket and walk away.
2. I agree not to hit or physically attack a female.
3. I agree to keep my eyes open as a protector to identify situations in which a female is at risk and will
try to take reasonable steps to help if possible.
4. I will encourage other males to take the Kectil Promise Leaders Pledge.
If you have already participated in ""1000 Males Campaign"", we encourage you to continue the pledge at
the website and keep up your mission of protecting females you took up and share the message to other
men.
If you have not, please do now!
One man can't make a change, but together we can definitely bring a better world for our females, girls,
our future daughters and granddaughters.

The Kectil Program


    The lectil Generation
      Positive. Change.
Mission
The Kectil Program was created to identify and nurture highly talented youth in developing countries
who have the potential to make a positive difference in their communities and countries.


Framework

We accomplish our Mission Statement by:
We accomplish our Mission Statement by (i) facilitating innovative leadership training and (ii) providing a
means to allow these highly talented youth become part of a guided network with other similarly
talented and passionate youth in developing countries who will support, nurture, teach and learn from
each other as they mature.
The Kectil Framework embodies both of the goals of the famous African proverb:
   ""Ifyou want to go fast, go alone; ifyou want to go far, go together.""


Kectil Code

The Kectil Code is the framework of the Kectil Program. Each participant is required to comply with
the Kectil Code.

   • Each participant shall be referred to as a Kectil Colleague and shall treat others as Colleagues.
   • Each Kectil Colleague will give equal respect to every other Kectil Colleague regardless of
      nationality, religion, culture or gender.
   • Each Kectil Colleague will discuss ideas and contributions of other Kectil Colleagues with positive,
      collaborative and respectful comments.
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS136_KectilGeneration","     • Each Kectil Colleague will honor the Developing Country Youth Leadership Network by creating
         positive, lasting bonds with other Kectil Colleagues with the intent to stay connected and
         positively support each other toward future leadership that adds value to the local and national
         community.
     • Each Kectil Colleague will carry out all the assignments of the program.
     • Each Kectil Colleague will use best effort to attend each webcast of the program.
     • Kectil Colleagues uphold the honor of the Kectil Program by treating others in his/her community
         with respect and compassion.
     • Kectil Colleagues will not take non-prescribed drugs or misuse alcohol.
     • If selected to attend the Developing Country Youth Leadership Conference in Atlanta, the Kectil
         Colleague will conduct himself/herself in a manner that is a role model for others and will be an
         excellent representative of his/her community.


The Kectil Program

""KECTIL"" is an acronym that refers to the Knowles Educational and Charitable Trust for
International Leadership.
The Kectil Program is based of the following principals:

     • Creating an authentic, collaborative network of high potential youth from developing and least
         developed countries can break down prejudices, lead to cultural, religious and gender
         understanding and give youth the comfort that they are more than just themselves- they are part
         of a mutual youth-based support system with the goal to make a positive difference in their lives,
         their Colleagues' lives and the lives of those in their communities.
     • Identifying, embracing and mentoring high potential youth (17-26) from developing and least
         developed countries can have a dramatic effect on the youths' dreams, service to others and life
         accomplishments.
     • Nothing comes easy and there is ""no free lunch."" The results will not be achieved without hard
         work, dedication and an open mindedness to cultural understanding and compassion.

The Program works to achieve these goals in three parts: a one-year Web-based Program, the
Developing Youth Leadership Conference in Atlanta, United States, and the Alumni Network.
Due to logistics and cost, more applicants can be accepted for the Web-based Program than the
Developing Youth Leadership Conference in Atlanta. If an applicant is accepted for the Web-based
Program but not the Developing Youth Leadership Conference, the applicant can apply the next year to
attend the Conference. All applicants accepted for either (i} the Web-based Program or (ii} the Web-
based Program and the Leadership Conference are encouraged to join and actively participate in the
Alumni Network at the end of the Program.

Developing Countries Youth Leadership Conference

Atlanta, Georgia

July 19th - July 27th, 2019

The Kectil Program hosted it's second one-week intensive leadership conference in Atlanta, Georgia. The
workshop will take place from July 22nd- July 27th, 2019. The Kectil Program selected thirty-one
participants from 15 developing countries to attend. The countries represented are Colombia, Egypt,
Guyana, India, Israel, Kenya, Lesotho, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saint Lucia, South Africa, Uganda,
Turkmenistan and Vietnam.
The conference held at the Georgia Institute of Technology Campus included intensive leadership
training on various topics moderated by Kectil Program Founder and Executive Director Sherry M.
Knowles. We were thrilled to have Mr. Martin Luther King Ill, Kectil Program Advisory Board Member, and
a Human Rights Advocate and Community Activist joining us during the conference with his daughter
Yolanda King for personal discussions with the youth.
We also had our advisory board member Dr. Alison Montgomery joining us to present a talk on
techniques for raising funds for community efforts and larger scale community projects. Dr. Montgomery
is highly experienced in the area of grants and loans for developing countries. We were also very
honored to be able to have a presentation by Dr. George Luber, a noted environmental
activist who studies the effect of climate on disease demographics. He is the Chief of the Climate and
Heath Program for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (""CDC"") in Atlanta.
We were also pleased to that AT&T, the huge telecommunications and entertainment company, invited
us to tour its AT&T Drive Studio in downtown Atlanta. We received a talk about AT& T's innovative efforts
to use the internet in all aspects of transportation and commerce. In addition, we were also invited to
tour the world headquarters for the business operations of The Coca-Cola Company. We will received
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS136_KectilGeneration","talks from Coca-Cola executives and the youth
were able to have photo opportunities there.
The highlight of the conference however, was the youth participants country presentation. Each
participant gave a one-hour presentation on their country's geography, history, culture, demographics
and the political and social environment. The youth also shared with us what it is like to grow up in their
country, the youth challenges, education, mentoring and how to identify and support transformational
youth leaders from their countries.
A critical aspect of the Conference was to create a youth leadership network of these highly talented
individuals who will form the Kectil Generation. They will support and draw from each other after the
conference and as they mature and take on various roles in their lives. Toward that end the Conference
include activities that are bonding experiences as well as ample time to discuss key topics facing each of
their communities.

""A genuine account from the youth on roles of females in their society from a grass-roots level."" - Sherry
M. Knowles
The book is a compendium of essays written by 60 youth leaders aged 17-26 from 30 developing
countries about the status of females in their countries. The youth discuss a wide range of topics from
discrimination, child marriages, unwed pregnancies, abuse, government programs, education and
religion, and provide suggestions for advancement. The candid perspectives span from positive reports
to problematic situations. This book provides extraordinary accounts directly from the youth themselves
about the daily conditions they live in.

The 1st African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) convened from 26th - 27th
October, 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, on the theme “African Youth Responses to Climate
Change and Food Security, Action from the Frontline.” The conference was organized by Africa
Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) in partnership with Africa Climate Policy Center
(ACPC), New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), Pan African Climate Justice
Alliance (PACJA) and Zimbabwe United Nations Association (ZUNA).
100 youths selected across Africa in the conference addressing the thematic strands of Youth in
Agribusiness; Climate Change and Development in Africa; Sustainable Agriculture and Food
Security; Green Economy and Technology Transfer; Climate Justice and Human Rights; and
Climate Change and Disaster risk reduction participated in this first edition of the African Youth
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC). This came at a time when Africa as a continent
continues to bear the biggest brunt of climate change due to low resilience and weak capacities,
with the youth despite their huge numbers and innovativeness among the vulnerable alongside
women. Despite the odds, they have been actively engaged in adaptation and mitigation




                                                                   O
initiatives that improve their communities’ resilience to climate change.
The conference therefore provided a platform for the African youths to interact and share best
practices. Five flagship projects were selected to be used as case studies by African Youths in
starting their own projects depending on transferability. The conference also saw the drafting of




                                                M
African youth position for COP 21 which was handed over to African Group of Negotiators at the
fifth Climate Change and Development in Africa Conference (CCDA V).

(AfriYOCC-2016)

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the environmental challenge of climate
change is already modifying Africa’s economies and livelihoods, health, social structure,
infrastructure and natural systems. Over the years, African youth have proved their potential in
both promoting and implementing climate change adaptation projects in their communities.
Their innovations have continually been adopted in responding to climate change impacts. This
is despite various challenges that include low capacity and education, high rates of poverty and
lack of financial resources. At the same time, African youth have been minimally represented in
the respective country policy processes as well as during the UNFCCC climate change
negotiations. Above 50% of the African population are the youth. This justifies the urgent need
for youth capacity development to respond to climate change and inclusion as key stakeholders
in policy process and negotiations. AYICC aims to spearhead new innovations, look into new
systems of success to share with policy and decision-makers, and generally aim to improve on
the current system which is causing long-term and irreversible degradation to our livelihoods –
as the leading youth organization on climate change in Africa.



                                                                    O
In cognizance of the role and potential of the African youth in climate change mitigation and
adaptation and overall sustainable development trajectory, the second African Youth




                                                 M
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC), shall be held in Nairobi, Kenya on 10th to 13th
October, 2016 as AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its formation in 2006 during the
second Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12. Building on the success of the first




                                               E
edition of conference, AfriYOCC shall provide an avenue for African youths to showcase their
climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, projects and initiatives. Best practices
arising from the various AYICC country chapters shall be developed to an African youth




                                    D
climate change adaptation and mitigation best practices database and handbook. The
meeting will dilate on the current post 2015 development agenda and the role of young
people in championing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in
Africa.

The delegates shall have an opportunity to visit ongoing Climate Change adaptation and
agribusiness projects in Kenya for hands-on skills and knowledge replicable in their countries.
Consequently, it shall boost the skills and capacities of African youths to substantially contribute
to the process leading towards and during COP 22. Through partnership with both
Governmental and Non-governmental agencies, the conference shall not only negotiate for
more youth representation in the respective country policy processes towards the forthcoming
CoPs and country specific policies, but also provide learning and engagement opportunities for
African youths. This will greatly enhance their current capacity and potential to actively
participate in both national and international platforms for policy formulation and implementation.
The conference will also provide a platform to re-assess the current position of our negotiators
and create awareness about the critical role young people should play in shifting agendas in the
forthcoming Conference of Parties in Marrakech come November 2016. While a 4 day gathering

issues affecting their livelihoods.

African youth have for long been side-lined to the periphery of the substantive civic and policy
issues facing the continent. However, the worst affected are the rural based youths and those
residing in farming communities, peri-urban areas and those from conflict and post conflict
countries. This has resulted in youths from these marginalized communities having no
knowledge and information on the basic climate change science and adaptation and mitigation
mechanisms. The good news though is that there is capacity amongst many young people who
are already in the circles of upcoming academia, policy specialists, lawyers, journalists and
scientists’ alike. These capacities need to be strengthened and skills shared amongst the wider
group of young people on the continent so that best practices are disseminated and resources
are expanded.

While it is an undeniable fact that climate change is affecting all regions globally, especially in
developing countries, the adverse effects in the future is likely to increase if the Paris agreement
is not ratified and effectuated by all parties. And even though a deal was achieved during
COP21 in Paris, the impacts of climate change will definitely continue into the future. This
suggests that young people will have to not just understand what climate change is and how it is




                                                                      O
affecting our world, opportunities that exists within, but most importantly, participate actively into
finding amicable solutions. Young people of Africa have therefore considered it an inherent
imperative to contribute to their future by organizing the 2nd African Youth Conference on
Climate Change in October 2016 under the theme, ‘Making Climate Finance work for




                                                  M
African Youth.’


2.1 CONFERENCE STRATEGY




                                                E
The conference program shall be based on exploring mechanisms to finance climate adaptation
and mitigation through Innovations in agriculture, technology and other sectors. It shall be




                                     D
highly interactive with unique workshop-style design that enables participants to develop their
potential through practical experience. Participants will divide to participate in thematic
workshops and come up with an African Youth position paper and concrete activities to be
included in the African Youth Strategy on Climate Change.

The delegates shall be engaged in pre-conference activities that shall include and not limited to,
mapping of youth climate change and/or mitigation projects within the conference key focus
areas for selection as best practice and include in the African youth climate change adaptation
and mitigation best practices database and handbook and aggressively fundraise towards their
participation and a successful workshop. The conference shall critically examine the various
country positions and the overall continents positions of the African Group of Negotiators, their
achievements and potentials towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It shall
examine the youth voices in these positions and further develop African youth position for
COP22.

We expect 200 youth leaders to participate in this conference. The conference is convened by
the AYICC continental secretariat in collaboration with AYICC Kenya chapter and the member

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is an umbrella youth network of African
based youth organizations, university groups, rural youth groups, schools, and individuals
working on climate change and sustainable development issues. It aims at developing capacity
and strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent need to take action
against the impacts of climate change for both present and future generations.

The initiative (always referred to as the movement) was conceived in Nairobi Kenya 10 years
ago, during the second Conference of Youth (COY2) preceding the 12th Conference of Parties
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC - COP12). The
main reason for its founding was to ensure the inclusion, and active participation of youths from
the south, and specifically Africa, in the international climate change negotiations. This was
needed as the youth are more than half the African population and are most affected by climate
change impacts. They also got massive potential to support the continent to take action on
global warming.

During its formation, it comprised of 8 country chapters and current has grown to 45 country
chapters with over 20,000 members across Africa and the Diaspora. This initiative has provided




                                                                  O
a platform for knowledge, ideas and experiences sharing. It is also an avenue for development
of skills and strategies on youth action on climate change mitigation and adaptation in the
African continent. AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a
platform for them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the




                                               M
UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others.

Since its inception, we have worked in partnership with international youth movements and have




                                             E
played a great role in the establishment of the International Youth Climate Movement whose
youth member organizations are now officially acknowledged by the UNFCCC as the YOUNGO
(Youth NGOs involved in the climate change negotiations process). Since COY2 in Nairobi, it




                                   D
has had youth delegates’ representation in all COP meetings.

In addition to the above, we have had landmark successes that include:
     A reach out programme for a children’s home (Watoto Wema in Ruai) and School
        climate change education program run in selected schools in Kenya.
     Leadership and mentorship programmes especially on volunteerism.
     Community development projects particularly on clean energy (energy saving stoves for
        rural folks)
     Capacity development of youth on agribusiness
     Advocacy campaigns e.g. lobbied for lanes to be set aside along the major highways for
        non-motorised transport especially for cyclists.
     Policy engagements i.e. contributing to the climate change bill 2012,as stakeholders
     Youth Caravan from Kenya to Durban during COP 17

African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) 2016

African Youth Conference on Climate Change will take place in Nairobi in Kenya. The conference is organized by the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change
(AYICC) and the African Climate Policy Centre from the 10 to 13 October 2016. AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its fonmation in 2006 during the second
Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12.

African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) www.ayicc.net is a continental youth network that was conceived in 2006 in Nairobi Kenya, during the
Conference of Youth held just before the UNFCCC COP12. This initiative has continued to link, and share knowledge, ideas, experiences, skills and strategies
on youth action around the continent on climate change, its mitigation and adaptation and sustainable development. In 2009, AYICC was granted observer
status to the African Minister Conference on Environment (AMCEN). AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a platform for
them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the Conference of Parties of UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others. AYICC
currently operates in over 45 African countries with over 20,000 members.

In response, to the call by AU Heads of Sates and Government to establish the CAHOSCC Youth Programme on Climate Change (CYPCC),

Founding Opportunities


AYICC Founding Opportunities

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the
environmental challenge of climate change will ultimately modify Africa's economies and livelihoods, health, social structure, infrastructure and natural
systems. To date little has been done to empower, capacitate and mobilise youth, particularly in Africa to address global environmental challenges such as
climate change. facebook d o w n ~ To remedy this, an initial step has been the formation of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC).

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change was formed partially in response to the poor representation of young Africans at the International Youth
Summit on Climate Change (November 24-28, 2005), which was held in conjunction with the United Nation's Climate Change Conference (November 28-
December 10, 2005) in Montreal , Canada. The overall mission of AYICC is to ensure that African youth are equipped toparticipate in future UNFCCC
meetings and other global initiatives for sustainable solutions to environmental degradation and climate change.

In order to ensure a strong youth presence in climate change dialogue and fora, there is a need for AYICC to ensure youth representation from various parts
of Africa. This will enable Africa's youth to engage with the global youth movement, governments and NGO's in a more coordinated and sustained manner.
The long term goal is to ensure sustainable and systematic global youth action, with special emphasis on African youth on the issue of climate change.

Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any financial assistance. The planning committee members have
volunteered their time and their contributions. However, in order to make this vision a reality we need to become a financially viable organisation. For this
reason, we would like to request your financial assistance in getting this vision off the ground.•

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE OPENING FORUM OF THE SEVENTH AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FORUM, 12TH OCTOBER

2010: Ms. Esther Agbarakwe, Nigeria




The Chair,

Climate Change poses significant challenges to future generations. As youth we have a stake in this future; it is our future.




                                                                                                                 O
As the 7th African Development Forum, we have indeed come of age, we are no longer in our childhood stages of determining sustainable development - the
time of maturity has arrived. This year is marked as the International Year of Youth and now, more than ever before, the youth are taking a stand. More than
anyone else, we, the Youth, face unprecedented challenges as a result of global climate change. We also share the responsibility of addressing ii. As a group,
we are key moral stakeholders in the international processes treating the most important challenge of our generation. As it is our future, we will be
disproportionately affected by the catastrophic impacts of climate change.

Advocacy and Behavior Change: II is critical for present and future leaders to collaborate on finding solutions. The need for cultural transformation in our time




                                                                              M
is stronger than ever. This transformation - that enables us to shift towards a more sustainable world - should be an organic process, guided by principles of
compassion, integrity and justice. We need to pragmatically rethink our behavioral patterns, to enable a paradigm shift that is based on an ongoing process of
action, reflection and meaningful participation. Awareness, education and empowerment are fundamental prerequisites to enabling this process, and the youth
are energetic and passionate about holding governments and all relevant stakeholders involved accountable for their actions. We are equal partners in this
process and commit ourselves fully to achieving the objectives as decided by this Forum.




                                                                            E
Contrary to what is believed; young people play a dynamic role in framing and implementing policies. So their role goes beyond advocacy. From an advocacy
perspective, young people are involved in songs and stories which spread awareness in local languages. Of course we understand the importance and
relevance of this because 70% of Africa is based in rural areas and the term Climate Change is foreign, Young people are finding ways of using words in local
languages to translate the message across.




                                                           D
It is time to shift the balance of decision-making towards the generation that will have to manage this unwanted inheritance, to make political and economic
decisions that can span a generation, and to enable real inter-generational and inter-cultural dialogue about climate change to be realized in institutions where
the youth generation can learn.

However at the same time a range of social learning and marketing approaches need to be developed to address the gap between classroom education styles
and education that stimulates real action. This gap prevents the cultural shift from token awareness to personal action and reaction.

Education: In relation to climate change, African Governments should begin at inception to mainstream youth voices and perceptions. This is particularly
important because climate change projections indicate that effects will begin to be most felt in the next 20-30 years - young people should begin to be part of
the solution so that they will be able to cope when disaster calls. Involving them in this programme will ensure that those who will be affected will have direct
knowledge of the challenges and strategies for coping as well as the ability to mobilize communities to respond to and prepare for the impact of climate change
and natural disasters.

Governments must give credence to the higher learning education system in Africa in particular the increased accent on improvement of research and
innovation on climate change specifically highlighting on policy and reform, the programmes, pedagogy and teaching tools. This will enhance an equipped pool
of intellectual capital among the young people on climate change issues who will replicate this to the various organizations and networks that they are part of.

Al government level, during the last Conference of the Parties (COP), ii was pleasing to see that many African delegations included youth and gave them a role
to play. Furthermore, many youth who were involved in COP 15 deliberations have been interacting with their various governments and engaging in processes
and procedures that are related to Climate change policy. There is an understanding that more needs to be done, and at this forum, I urge you to engage young
people who knock on your doors asking to be involved.

Youth and youth based NGOs play a major role either in strengthening local capacity to cope or by supporting local action. Already, groups such as the Nigerian
Youth Coalition and the African youth Climate Initiative-Kenya have established school climate clubs, which are creative ways to engage young people; these
initiatives should be mainstreamed into education systems. Young people in this governance process are important because successful adaptation requires a
host of innovative measures developed with vulnerable communities to improve their present and future livelihoods. Young people are vibrant and are able to
access places that many governmental institutions fail to access. As the majority of the population and Africa's future, it is important to include them in this
impending crisis that is Climate Change.

Already, this conference calls for integrated approaches to enable African countries to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change. There is a dire need
to have a clearer understanding of the potential calamities that climate change can bring and to start the discourse on how best to stave off the worst impacts.
There is already an understanding that

Climate Change is not a localized problem but transcends national borders, hence the need for co-operation of Intergovernmental agencies but also to include
those young and vulnerable people.

Conclusion :
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS143_AfricanYouthCouncilonClimateChange","No longer can climate change be seen as merely an environmental problem or an energy challenge. It is a combination of both, which needs the involvement of
young people to preserve the environment and enter into green energy careers.

It's important for all of us to recognize that sustainable development isn't just a catch phrase - people all over the continent are taking it into their own hands. A
couple days ago over 300 community events took place in nearly every country on the continent of Africa, and more than 7000 globally as part of the Global
Work Party on 10/10/10.

Everywhere in the wortd, people planted trees, cultivated community gardens, installed solar panels, made buildings more efficient and implemented thousands
of other grassroots solutions to the climate crisis. We got to work everywhere in the world, but we need you, leaders, to get to work, too.

Thank you and God bless

                        African Youth at COP25

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS143_AfricanYouthCouncilonClimateChange","The 25th session of the Conference Parties (COP25) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held from the 2 -13
December bringing together nearly 27000 people to the Spanish capital. COP25
provided parties with the opportunity to finalize the ""rulebook"" of the Paris
Agreement - the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020.


In the spirit of the convention on climate change young people continue to enjoy




                                                                          O
various spaces during COP mainly through YOU NGO; the official youth
constituency to the UNFCCC. Article 6 ofthe Convention and Article 12 of the
Paris Agreement referred to as Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) encourage
the empowerment of every member of the society to take climate actions and
therefore young people who are most vulnerable to the climate crisis are




                                             M
increasingly becoming the centre of discussion.


The world today is home to the largest generation of young people in history and
their energy, creativity, and innovation, when harnessed properly, will accelerate




                                           E
sustainable solutions to the global crisis. Youth have a pivotal role to play in the
implementation of ACE which consists of six elements namely: education,
training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and
international cooperation.




                             D
At COP25, the Intergenerational Inquiry which is a highlight event of Young and
Future Generations Day and like every year provided a platform for youth and
decision-makers to discuss how young people can enhance the implementation
of the Paris Agreement. This platform was attended by the Executive Secretary of
the UNFCCC and provided an opportunity for young people to share the
outcome on the Conference of Youth (COY 15) to the secretariat.


The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) has continued to
empower and mobilize young people at COP through our side events and
exhibitions. Through an exhibition at COP 25, AYICC was able to showcase the
actions and contributions of African youth in the fight against climate change.
Such actions include ecological restorations, renewable energy promotion, and
local conference of youth hosted by our national chapters.


AYICC's greatest concern however, is with regards to the low representation of
African youth at the UNFCCC sessions. There are many contributing factors which
includes lack of funding, inability to assess accreditations and visas. As the first
step in addressing this, we will continue to encourage African countries to make
conscious efforts to include youth delegates in their official delegations for COPs.
We also call on development partners and stakeholders who are interested in
youth development to reach out with their support to AYICC to enhance African
youth participation in this important global process.

• Renewable energy promotion
 With the increasing demand for energy for industrial and economic
 development, AYICC member organizations in different countries are
 promoting renewable energy access to isolated off-grid communities. AYICC
 believes that Youth-led renewable energy enterprises are a viable means of
 achieving sustainable development, as they promote technologies that are
 less harmful to the global environs while at the same time providing
 sustainable income-generating opportunities for youth .



• Youth in Agribusiness
 AYICC sees agriculture as an essential driver of economic development and an
 area of great opportunity for young people in Africa. The challenge, however,
 is that the growing youth population does not see agriculture as a profitable
 opportunity due to their lack of insight into the opportunities that exist within
 the agriculture value chain. Through our member organizations who are youth
 farmers themselves, AYICC has adopted various strategies including outreach
 to schools and communities, exhibitions and youth agricultural festivals as
 well as institution of award schemes for best youth farmers as a way to raise
 interest and awareness on the opportunities that exist within this sector.

                            products as a by-product of the increasing level of population, affluence, and
                            technological advancement in a given environment or society. In Africa we
                            have witnessed increasing level of pollution from plastic, car tires, bottles
                            among others and this has generated innovative thinking among young
                            people to provide a sustainable solution. Over the years, AYICC members have
                            redefined waste as a resource for sustainable development and through
                            various recycling initiatives, they are bringing life into materials that otherwise
                            could have been a nuisance to the environment.
