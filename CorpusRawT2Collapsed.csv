We are proud of the\noutstanding results we have been able to deliver\nin our first 14 years. These milestones include:\n\n• The program has over 360 students on full\n  scholarships at 62 colleges and universities in\n  the US, Canada, Kenya, Uganda, Ghana,\n  South Africa, including Yale University, MIT,\n  Harvard University, Smith College, McGill\n  University, University of Cape Town (South\n  Africa), Kwame Nkrumah University (Ghana)\n  and Jomo Kenyatta University (Kenya).\n• Zawadi students have excelled in their studies\n  with an average GPA of 3.75 out of 4.0.\n• Zawadi has raised over USD 70 million in\n  scholarship funds since inception in 2002.\n• Zawadi Africa program has had a 100%\n  retention and graduation rates to date, with 55\n"",

Of this\nnumber, 14% get married before the age of 15\nand 38% before the age of 18. Further research\nindicates that when a girl in the developing world\nreceives 7 or more years of education, she\nmarries 4 years later. When she spends 2 extra\nyears in school, her wage earnings are boosted\nby 45%. In addition,higher levels of education\nresult in better infant and child wealth.\n\nIn rural areas of Kenya, girl lack role models who\nhelp widen their horizons. As such they lack\nambition, drop out of school due to teenage\npregnancies, early marriages as second or third\nwives and later bear children they can barely\nafford to raise. Lack of tertiary education and life\nskills only serves to worsen the situation, as they\nremain jobless. Their daughters fall into the\nsame circumstances as their mothers, as this is\nall they know. The cycle continues.\n\nBeyond the Classroom serves the dual purpose\nof serving as a high school retention tool for girls\nfor whom the future does not hold much promise,\nand preparation for successful entry into the\nhighly competitive post-secondary school world.\nFurther, it strives to equip high school girls with\nthe life skills that they need in order to make\nintelligent choices by enhancing effective\ndecision making skills, encouraging goal setting\nand building confidence.\n\nProjects bv Zawadi Scholars\n"",

Everyone who applies and is then admitted to ALA,\n  regardless of financial background or nationality, is eligible to receive significant\n  financial assistance* in the form of scholarships and loans towards studying at\n  ALA and accessing membership to our lifelong network. The cost of tuition at\n  ALA is USD $30,900 per year.\n\n  At ALA, the value of financial awards is determined after admissions decisions\n  have been made. Fees charged to a given student will be based on a family's\n  financial means. We expect that every family will stretch themselves to finance\n  the ALA education, just as we ask ALA's network of supporters from around the\n  world to stretch themselves to ensure that every admitted student is able to\n  attend. Students from more financially disadvantaged backgrounds receive more\n  significant financial assistance from ALA, and families with more resources are\n  expected to contribute more to their child's education at ALA.\n\n  Every student will sign the ALA Social Contract - a commitment to contribute to\n  peace and prosperity on the continent for at least 10 years in return for the\n  financial assistance provided by our community.\n"",

After reading this memo you should have clarity\nand understanding of:\n\n    1.   Our Guiding Principles\n    2.   What the ALA Social Contract is\n    3.   What your ALA tuition fees entail\n    4.   What the terms of the financial assistance agreement mean\n    5.   What the deferment process entails\n    6.   Who to contact should you have comments or queries\n\n\n1. Our Guiding Principles\n\nAt African Leadership Academy, we believe that financial circumstances should not impede a student from reaching\ntheir full potential, and should not rob Africa of its most promising talent. When we admitted you to ALA, we made\na statement about our belief in your potential to transform the continent, and about our commitment to empower\nyou on your leadership journey.\n\nIf you and your family cannot afford or independently finance your education at ALA, we have, through the\ngenerosity of our donors, made institutional loans available to you. Our loans, unlike almost any other loan you may\nseek, are forgivable if you meet the terms of your financial assistance agreement, because our loans are a social\ncontract between you and the entire ALA community.\n\n2. The ALA Social Contract\n\nA social contract is an agreement for mutual benefit between an individual or group and the government, an\norganisation or community as a whole. At ALA, donors, parents, students, alumni, and staffulty come together to\nsupport ALA’s mission to promote lasting peace and shared prosperity on the African continent. We do this by\nidentifying, developing, and connecting the next generation of African leaders. Under ALA’s model, students’\nfinancial circumstances are not considered during the admissions process (we have “need-blind admissions”), and all\nadmitted students can receive need-based financial assistance in the form of a forgivable loan to ensure they can\nattend the Academy.\n\nThe ALA forgivable loan agreement is a social contract entered into between the incoming student and the entire\nALA community. The members of our community have come, and continue to come together, in order to develop\nleaders for the continent. Therefore, the loan is forgiven for the alumni that return to have impact on the continent\nfor at least 10 years after their 25th birthday (or from the moment they complete their undergraduate degree,\nwhichever comes first).\n\nALA is not expecting you to fulfil your part of the social contract on your own. We have made a lifelong\ncommitment to the development of your career, and have established the Department of Lifelong Engagement to\nassist you in your career development.\n\n3. What Your Tuition Fees Entail\n\nThe total cost of attending ALA is split between your student contribution and your proposed ALA financial\nassistance award. You will pay your contribution to fees during your time on campus at ALA, per the payment\n\n                                                 African Leadership Academy NPC\n                               Reg.

If you choose to accept our financial assistance award, ALA will cover the\ndifference between your expected student contribution and ALA’s full tuition through a financial assistance award.\nOur financial assistance award is an option for you, not an obligation. You must let us know if you choose to accept\nit, or if you will find other means to cover the gap between your expected student contribution and ALA’s full\ntuition.\n\nIf you choose to accept ALA’s financial assistance please read below to understand the terms of your Financial\nAssistance Agreement.\n\nPlease note that financial assistance is optional, therefore this section may not be applicable to all students\n\n4. Understanding Key Terms in Your Financial Assistance Award Agreement\n\nDuring the Admissions process of enrolment at ALA, you will sign two key documents, namely:\n\n     1. The ALA Enrolment Contract; and\n     2. ALA Financial Assistance Award Agreement (Optional)\n\n\nThe ALA Financial Assistance Award Agreement contains key terms which require thorough understanding. Below\nis a summary of the key terms and their interpretations:\n\nForgivable Loan\n\nA forgivable loan is a form of a loan in which its entirety, or a portion of it, can be forgiven by the lender when\ncertain conditions are met. However, if the conditions are not met, the loan has to be repaid, usually with interest.\nALA’s financial assistance is structured this way to honour the promise under which ALA’s past and present donors\nchose to support ALA, namely, to develop leaders who will develop the African continent. The interpretation of this\nstatement has been, and continues to be, that our young leaders will have the most impact on the continent by being\npresent on the continent. Therefore, the loan is forgivable on condition of your physical return and residence on the\ncontinent.\n\n\n3.2 Establish residence and employment in Africa for a period of 10 years\n\nThe interpretation of ‘employment’ has been broadened to mean ‘reside in Africa’. This means that as long as you\nare physically present on the African continent, ALA will assume your residence to also mean you are positively\ncontributing economically and socially to the African continent. Entrepreneurial ventures, part-time or full-time\nemployment, pursuing any post-graduate education – (such as graduate school, a second degree, a PhD, etc.) will\nalso count to fulfil the terms of your contract. Your mere presence in Africa is enough. Please note that the\nabovementioned examples are not exhaustive.\n\nYou are required to be physically present on the African continent for a minimum of 10 years to qualify for the full\nloan forgiveness. Every year you spend on the African continent after your undergraduate degree counts toward\nforgiveness. 1/10th of your loan will be forgiven every year you spend on the African continent, meaning that by the\nend of the 10th year, your loan will be fully forgiven.\n\nPlease note that as a general rule, any time spent on the African continent prior to age 25 or before completing your\nundergraduate degree will not count towards forgiveness. Gap years, starting a venture before (or instead of going\nto) college, complete internships, etc., may be considered towards your Return To Africa commitment on a case-by-\ncase basis.\n\n                                                        African Leadership Academy NPC\n                                      Reg.

In a way, compounded interest can be thought of as “interest on\ninterest,” and can be contrasted with simple interest, which is interest calculated only on the principal loan amount.\n\nYour financial assistance loan begins accruing interest immediately after your studies at ALA begin and continues to\ndo so until the loan is forgiven or paid in full. The interest rate for your loan is set at 18% per year.\n\n\n5. Applying for Deferment\n\nShould you wish to postpone your return to the African continent after your 25th birthday, you have the option of\ndeferment available to you.

Deferment will be granted on a case by case basis.\n\nThe interest on the loan will continue to accrue during the deferment period. You must apply for deferment if you\nare planning to reside out of Africa (for any reason) after your 25th birthday. To apply for deferment, you will need\nto submit a deferment application form, motivational letter and additional documentation (where required) to\nstudentloans@africanleadershipacademy.org. A panel will then review your application, and provide your results\nwithin 3 weeks.\n\n 6.

She was diagnosed with a lung\n                 condition that causes her to use a breathing aid 24/7. When\n                 Sindi joined our ECD programme, Empowerment case\n                 administrators encouraged the family to join the support\n                 group for parents of children with disabilities.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       29\n                 Sindi’s first months in the programme were tough as she\n                 was overly hyperactive and disrupted the class often. Her\n                 hyperactivity meant that her breathing aid needed to be\n                 cleaned continuously.\n\n                 Her teachers encouraged her to focus her energy on\n                 creative art, painting and puzzles. With the aid of Lego\n                 Blocks and daily reading, they slowly began to develop\n                 her cognitive skills.

This continued until I                                                                           placed in a learnership in the Hospitality Industry.\n                      lost a friend in a fight, between my friends and boys from a\n                                                                                                                                                       I aim to influence the next generation of dreamers, to\n                      neighbouring community. At this time, I was 19 and doing my\n                                                                                                                                                       go out there and challenge themselves to be the best.

I had never seen my family so happy, maybe\n                      it’s because I’m the eldest of my siblings.

Her younger brother, Sipho* is\n                      9 years old and they both attend primary school. Three years ago, Lulama’s HIV-\n                      positive mother fell ill. She was in and out of hospital before she finally passed away.\n                      The children were left without a caregiver. During that time, Lulama stopped taking\n                      her medication and was admitted to hospital. She lost a lot of weight and her diet\n                      was very poor, affecting her attendance and performance at school. The children\n                      were referred to Afrika Tikkun.\n\n                      Through Afrika Tikkun’s intervention, the children’s maternal uncle decided to\n                      take them in. Afrika Tikkun equipped the uncle and his wife with parenting skills,\n42\n\n\n\n\n                      knowing that they had to take care of two children of their own. “We also supported\n                      the family with food parcels and other donations. We made sure Lulama was taking\n                      her treatment. We also taught the aunt how to care for a child with HIV”.\n\n                      Lulama attends Afrika Tikkun every day – where she receives a healthy meal and\n                      plenty of emotional and academic support. In recognition of how much she has\n                      progressed and matured, she was selected to attend a leadership camp.\n\n                      *not their real names\n\n\n                      “I learnt a lot from that experience. I really appreciate what Afrika Tikkun has done for my family and me”,\n                      she says. She is now taking her medication and is on a healthy diet. She is a healthy and happy child. Her\n                      class teacher also reports that she is doing well at school.\n\n\n\n\n     ··............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... •·····\n"",

""                 SIBONGILE’S MEMORIES OF\n                 THE USA\n                 My name is Sibongile, and I was fortunate enough to go to\n                 the USA on the 3rd – 30th of April. The first day of traveling\n                 was overwhelming, it was my first time being at the airport\n                 and my very first time seeing a plane. That day Sipho took\n                 us to Mug n’ Bean before our flight, which was also my first\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       51\n                 being in such an expensive restaurant. When I boarded\n                 the plane my heart thumped with excitement, and when it\n                 started moving I felt as if I was on a carnival ride. After we\n                 landed in Boston our hosts took us to go watch a baseball\n                 match and at the end of the game, they bought us Redsoxx\n                 sweaters, gloves and hats.\n\n                 After the game we went to watch the Boston marathon\n                 and then bowling, were we spent a day having fun with the\n                 members of the junior board. One of my highlights was going\n                 to Harvard University and going to Bobby Sager’s house.

During our stay in Las\n                 Vegas we participated in the Safelite marathon. The next day                                                                     Sibongile\n                 we went to Columbus Ohio where we went to the Safelite\n                 headquarters and saw a windshield being fixed.\n\n\n··............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... •·····\n"",

ELF exists to increase the participation of\nyoung men and women in governance and policy processes in order to promote\ndignity in society through increased accountability and service delivery on the\npart of duty bearers. We believe that when youth are equipped with the relevant\nknowledge, skills, and competencies, they begin to participate more strategically\nand productively in leadership and governance processes.\n\n\n\nOUR STORY\nELF was started in 2012 in Kenya to reach out to young people between 15 - 35\nyears, to help them discover their purpose, utilize their potential and become the\nbest they can be in life. In Kenya just like in other African countries, young people\naccount for more than 50 per cent of the total population.\n\n\nAs an organization, we believe that young people are the best resource that any\nnation has to be able to sustain growth and prosperity. At the moment the reality\nis that majority of young people in Kenya and Africa at large are in the periphery\nof decision making and policy processes.\n"",

Devolution is still a work in progress, with multiple loopholes both in law and\n   implementation. Its success is hinged, in part, on robust public participation, especially\n   from the youths\n2. The National Government’s Big Four Agenda offers a defined avenue through which\n   youth can deepen their participation in devolution, especially in view of the ongoing plans\n   to align these 4 sectors (manufacturing, job creation, universal health and affordable\n   housing) with the developmental plans of the devolved units.\n\n\n3. Politics and hero-leadership has taken undue status in the country. Political competition\n   has taken precedence over development planning.\n\n4. Oversight in the county governments has been marred with multi-layered conflicts of\n   interest by players.\n\n\n\n\n   Position Paper, 2nd Youth and Devolution Symposium, 2019                            Page 2\n"", 
""5. Optimal realization of public participation will depend on synergies, which youth must\n   forge, at the county level, to consolidate their agenda, expand their platform and amplify\n   their voice as a united front.\n\n\n\n   Finally, the delegates recommended that:\n\n\n1. For effective promotion of youth development projects, county governments in\n   partnership with all stakeholders should make deliberate efforts to develop youth-centred\n   development programmes informed by an all-inclusive consultative process.\n2. The Ministry of Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs, through the State Department\n   of Youth needs to harness youth-serving efforts at all levels of National and County\n   government to leverage on available platforms for young people. This can be achieved\n   through an inter-agency for information sharing and programme coordination.\n3. All county governments take up open tender systems to weed out institutionalised\n   corruption in that sector.\n\n\n4. There is need for county governments to increase responsiveness to youth issues, not only\n   in policy articulation in the CIPDs, but also through budgetary allocations and visible,\n   auditable projects.\n\n\n5. All youth across the country ought to support the government’s renewed war on\n   corruption, which has had pervasive effects on youths by curtailing their participation in\n   governance and access to government services.\n\n\n6. All youth ought to embrace a value-driven life especially those in positions of\n   responsibility. This is, in many ways, the anchor of good governance.\n\n7. Individuals and institutions working within youth spaces especially at the county level,\n   should seek to build networks, eliminate silo mentality and define common issues that\n   they can pursue collectively.\n\n\n\n\n   Position Paper, 2nd Youth and Devolution Symposium, 2019                           Page 3\n"", 
""   8. In spite of the progress made in creating a conducive environment for youth to benefit\n       from devolution, a lot more needs to be done in adjusting the current policy, legal,\n       regulatory and institutional framework to respond to emerging realities on youth issues.\n       The approval of the Draft National Youth Policy needs to be expedited by the Cabinet.\n\n\nOverall, it is our aspiration that more partners, both state and non-state, will work together, to\ncontinue bringing youth and youth-led organizations, at the center of policy making within their\nrespective counties.\n\n\nAhead of the 3rd Youth and Devolution Symposium in 2019, we expect to see the following,\namong other things:\n   \uf0a7   Increased public awareness of the role of youth in implementation of devolution in\n       Kenya. Specifically, deepening their awareness of the opportunity to take part in policy\n       and decision-making in their respective counties.\n   \uf0a7   Constructive engagement and influence of youth in the devolved functions\n   \uf0a7   Strengthened capacity and role of youth and local organizations in implementation of\n       devolution.\n   \uf0a7   Strengthened accountability mechanisms for youth actors in the devolution space.\n\nRatification of the Position Paper:\nThe participants unanimously agreed with the contents of this position paper, and by motion, the\nfollowing two delegates ratified it on behalf of the other participants:\n   1. Ms. Winnie Mukosi – Delegate, Makueni County\n   2. Mr. Ken Ruto – Delegate, Uasin Gishu County\n\n_________\nRead Out by: Edward Kipkalya, ELF.\n\n\n\n\n       Position Paper, 2nd Youth and Devolution Symposium, 2019                            Page 4\n""

In particular, we aim to track individual trajectories to determine personal award\noutcomes, as well as exploring the cumulative impact of awards on wider socioeconomic development.\n\n\nSurveys\nEach year we send out surveys to incoming Commonwealth Scholars and Fellows and alumni to gather\ninformation about their pre- and post-scholarship/fellowship careers. From alumni, we collect details on\nthe knowledge and skills that they gained during their award, and their ability to apply these skills in the\nworkplace after returning home. We also ask for details of their activities, and the impact they are having in\nkey development sectors.\n\n\nWe are also interested in the experiences and views of other stakeholders and partners; we survey hosts,\nemployers, and overseas nominating agencies. We also undertake ad hoc survey exercises.\n\n\nFindings from these surveys are reported to the CSC's E&M Committee and the wider Commission, and are\nalso P-Ublished for wider dissemination.\n\n\n\n\nInterviews and focus group discussions\nUnderstanding the experiences of our Scholars and Fellows while they are in the UK and after they return\n"",

We have experimented with counterfactual approaches, aligned\ndata collection tools across programmes to allow for future comparative review, and developed a new\nlongitudinal survey methodology. Upcoming priorities include building on existing qualitative work, and\ndeveloping new and improved means of publishing and disseminating our findings.\n\n\n\nScholarship evaluation: collaborating with others\nThe CSC is continually striving to improve its approach to scholarship evaluation.

""ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank the many people and organizations who have contributed to this mapping study. Thank you\nto all those who contributed their valuable time to participate in interviews, and share their experience\nand expertise with us, and who helped to outline and refine information about some of the initiatives and\nprograms available to displaced youth in each of the countries of study. Special thank you to those who\ntravelled and came together in late September 2019 for a Stakeholder Engagement Workshop to validate and\ndeepen the findings and recommendations in this mapping study.\n\nA particular thank you to all the young refugees and internally displaced people who so openly and\nhonestly shared their experiences, knowledge, ideas, and recommendations related to higher education and\nemployment.\n\nThank you to the WUSC team, notably Michelle Manks and Katharine Im-Jenkins, for guiding this project,\nproviding ongoing direction, editing, and moral support over the course of a very busy summer project. A big\nthank you to Stephanie McBride for helping to recruit field researchers and her genius writing support on\nthis mapping study. Thank you to Stephanie Leclair for thoroughly reviewing and editing the final version.\n\nWe would like to thank the country field researchers, Aurelia Muthoni Munene in Kenya, Simon Marot\nTouloung in Uganda, Imrana Buba and Sakina Hashim in Nigeria, and Alemneh Tadele in Ethiopia, for their\nstrong convening and research skills and their critical contributions to this mapping study.\n\nWe would like to share a special thank you to the many organizations who helped with access, outreach, and\ncoordination to enable us to run the focus groups in the camps and settlements. In particular, the WUSC\nNairobi office, UNHCR, Windle International Kenya and Windle International Uganda.\n\nFinally, thank you to Mastercard Foundation for contracting this research and enabling WUSC to learn\nand share what we learned about the experiences of displaced youth in accessing higher education and\nemployment and the opportunities and programs that are in place to support them. In particular, thank you\nto Karen Meyer, Shona Bezanson, Hélène Grégoire, Joseph Munyambanza, and Wendy Nakigudde for their\nvision, leadership, ongoing support, direction, connections on the ground, comments, and revision work.\n\nWe hope that this mapping study helps to inform future programming on education and scholarships that\ncontribute to enhancing the capacity of, and enabling greater opportunities for displaced youth in Africa.\n\n\n\n\n                                        From Higher Education to Employment for Displaced Youth in Africa | 3\n"",

I certainly treasure the chance to contribute to this great calls that challenges young\nminds, breaming with vast potentials and untapped energies, to take our continent to greater heights of\nexcellence.\n\n                                                                                     Abraham Simutanyi, Zambia\n\n\nMy AYGC experience was a mind transforming one that has changed my perception of making impact. I think\nin a more collaborative sense now and I do not take leadership grooming lightly. My world has grown bigger\nbecause of networking, and I believe more than ever that Africa has a future in its youth,who are ready to\npush the continent to where it rightly belongs.\n\n                                                                                      Margaret Blankson - Ghana\n\n\nAYGC 2019 for me was a very surreal experience because it was a dream come true. It was a one of a kind\nexperience designed to develop the potentials of the youth across the globe. It exposed me to what it takes\nto be a leader. It made me think about my continent and the world in a very positive light and ignited a\nburning fire in me to do my best as a young African to improve my lot and help develop my continent.\nI met like minds who are passionate about Africa and concerned about what we can do to improve the\ncontinent. I have formed lasting relationships with young people from Africa and the Diaspora which I intend\nto keep for life. I recommend the AYGC experience to every young person.\n\n                                                                                     Esther Yayra Attipoe - Ghana\n\nAYGC 2019 was a wonderful experience for me, I’ve never attended a youth program this well organized and\nevery youth at the convergence was treated with respect, profound recognition and prestige which made us\nrealize our importance in national development and the development of Africa in general.\n\nMy perspective on leadership, governance and the youth has taken a different turn, prior to AYGC I was made\nto believe politics was a dirty game but then we were reminded by the Former President of Nigeria, His\nExcellency Chief Olusegun Obasanjo that, the adults will not simply wake up in a day and hand over power to\nthe youth and therefore challenged delegates and African youth to rise up and take our space because we\nare the leaders of today not tomorrow.\n\n                                                                              Violet Miyanda Munsaka - Zambia\n\nThe convergence gave me the opportunity to network with the youth from other African countries and the\nDiaspora. Building this strong bond with fellow youth from other African countries and the diaspora helped\ndeepened my understanding of the common issues affecting African youth and the continent as a whole.\n\nConsistent with the convergence theme “Partnerships for youth development: Key to building a continent\nbeyond aid”, I am inspired to build networks and develop partnerships to build my community and country\nTanzania beyond aid.\n\n                                                                                        Judith Mbakize, Tanzania\n"",

"""", ""                                             Conference Overview\nAfrica is experiencing the most rapid urbanization in the world today, and has 65% of her over\n1.1billion population under the age of 35years. According to a Mo Ibrahim report of 20121, it is\nestimated that between 2000 and 2100, Africa will gain 340 million young people, compared to a\nnet increase of 137 million in the whole world, due to diminishing cohorts in Europe, Latin America\nand Asia and this will increase the continent’s share of the global youth population from 15% to\n41%.\n\nCognizant of the fact that investment in African youth will generate substantial national and\ncontinental development multiplier, Youth Bridge Foundation (YBF) initiated in 2009 the African\nYouth and Governance Conference (AYGC). The initiative provides the opportunity for the youth\nto discuss and find solutions to issues affecting them and the development of the continent whilst\nadvocating for their inclusion in policy development processes and the broader governance realm.\n\nIn 2014, GIZ on behalf of the Ministry for Economic Development and Cooperation of the Federal\nRepublic of Germany under its “Commitment for Africa” Programme, supported YBF to\ncollaborate with the International Office of the European Youth Parliament (EYP) to organize the\nfirst ever Euro-African Youth Parliament in Berlin, from 27th March to 4th April, 2014. The\nevent, which was attended by 100 youth delegates (50 from 20 Africa Countries), served as a\nunique platform for cross-cultural learning and capacity building on the EYP model of youth\nengagement and participation.\n\nBuilding on the outcomes of previous AYG-Conferences and the hosting to southern Africa, the 6th\nAYGC was held at the MIKA Convention Center in Lusaka, Zambia from the 4th-8th August, 2014.\nThe Lusaka 2014 conference introduced the use of Committee system, Team Building, Grande\nDebate (General Assembly), delegates-led media and event coordination as capacity building and\nhands-on learning opportunities for attendees. This enabled conference participants to deliberate and\nreflect on continental and global issues using knowledge, skills and creativity for Africa’s\ndevelopment.\n\nTargeting youth aged 18-35years, the conference was anchored on the three pillars of Policy,\nParticipation and Mobilization. The conference approach involved the following           3-pronged\nengagements:\n    \u0083 Youth to Youth: Promote youth interactions, networks and partnerships across\n        cultures/borders. This comprised the use of Committee system, which allowed delegates to\n        engage with fellow youth, carry out research on issues to produce informed\n        recommendations in the form of resolutions the conference climax -Grande Debate (General\n        Assembly). The Committees were chaired by pre-selected and trained youth delegates who\n        report to the Conference Board comprising the President and Vice Presidents of the session.\n\n      \u0083   Youth and Policy Makers: Empower and support youth as agents of social inclusion and\n          peace. This comprised complementary engagements between the committees and subject\n          area specialists’ dubbed expert sessions to offer delegates with practical knowledge and\n          information to guide the preparation of their resolutions and presentations at the Grande\n          Debate.\n\n      \u0083   Youth and Corporate Africa: Partnerships for youth development, peace and business\n          development.

At the May 2012 Consultation in\n           Cameroon, IofC representatives from Africa decided to put maximum effort\n           into this priority in order to make a measurable impact on the fight against\n           corruption and to help strengthen civil, political and business institutions in\n           Africa in the service of their people.\n\n\n           What is Good Governance?\n\n\n           Three elements were identified as encompassing the content and outreach of\n           good governance:\n\n            • Incorruptible leadership.

It grew out of the work\n         of Frank Buchman ( 1878-1961 ). an American Lutheran minister. Buchman\n"", 
""affirmed that there is a divine purpose for the world and everyone in it, and\ndemonstrated the connection between faith and change in society. Over the\nyears his work expanded to include people of different religions and none. In\nthe 1920s his work became known as the Oxford Group and in 1938 was\nnamed Moral Re-Armament. It changed its name to Initiatives of Change in\n2001. The timeline below marks some key moments in this ongoing work.\n\n\n 1908 ~                     Frank Buchman\n\n\n                            Buchman, an American Lutheran minister of Swiss\n                            descent who was the originator of Initiatives of\n                            Change, has a spiritual experience of release from\n                            bitterness in crucial relationships that alters the\n                            course of his life\n\n\n The Oxford Group (1927)\n\n\nBuchman's experience in 1908 convinces him that moral\n compromise destroys human character and relationships\n and that moral clarity is a prerequisite for building a just\n society. His ideas take root at Oxford and in some\n American universities and his work becomes known as\n the 'Oxford Group'.\n\n\n 1935 ~                  Alcoholics Anonymous\n\n\n                         Buchman's ideas spread through the 1930s into many\n                         sectors and on to other continents. Alcoholics\n                         Anonymous is established in 1935 as a direct result of\n                         the liberating experiences which some people find\n                         through their contact with the Oxford Group.\n\n\n Moral Re-Armament                                                                1938\n\n\n As European nations re-arm for war, Buchman calls\n for 'moral and spiritual re-armament' as the way to\n build a 'hate-free, fear-free, greed-free world'.\n Following World War II, Moral Re-Armament\n (MRA), as it becomes known, launches a programme\n"",

He believed that God has a\npurpose for people's lives and for mankind as a\nwhole, and he encouraged people to seek God's\nwisdom in regular times of silence and reflection.\nBuchman, a devout Christian, described Moral Re-\nArmament as 'the good road of an ideology inspired\nby God upon which all can unite. Catholic, Jew and\nProtestant, Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist and\nConfucianist - all find they can change, where needed\nand travel along this good road together.'\n\n\n1946 ~                          Caux, Switzerland\n\n\n                                MRA opens an international conference center\n                                in Caux, Switzerland, which is made possible\n                                through the generosity and hard work of\n                                hundreds of Swiss citizens.\n\n\nGermans to Caux                                                            1947\n\n\nAt a time when any contact with the Germans\nis extremely difficult, Buchman and his\ncolleagues invite Germans to Caux. Over the\nnext four years growing number of Germans\nand French come to Caux and their\nencounters become the basis of a massive\ndevelopment in reconciliation. Buchman is\nlater decorated by both the German and\nFrench governments for his contribution to\nEuropean reconciliation.\n\n\n1949 ~                              Reconciliation\n\n\n                                    Conferences at Caux and similar ones at\n                                    Mackinac Island in the US, achieve further\n                                    public recognition through several other\n                                    major contributions to international\n"",

It is a programme of\n          Initiatives of Change (IofC), a network of people committed to the\n          transformation of society based on change in individuals starting with\n          themselves.\n\n\n          Participants are challenged to examine their relationships and role in society\n          through times of reflection, plenary sessions, workshops and community work.\n          They are encouraged to look at their own hopes, fears and motivations and\n          examine their relationships with an aim to make a collective search for answers\n          to common issues and concerns faced in the region.\n\n\n          Vision\n\n\n          An Africa that is economically prosperous, politically vibrant, ecologically\n          sustainable and socially inclusive a continent of people who celebrate their\n          cultural heritage and diversity, bringing hope to the world (Developed by\n          Harambee 5 participants in Ethiopia, 2009)\n\n\n          Objectives\n\n\n          1.

""Birth of EAYF\n\n\nAfter the 5th Harambee Africa leadership training by Initiatives of Chang in\nEthiopia in 2009, that implored on relevant and tactful leadership in responding\nto issues facing Africa, the delegates from the Eastern Africa bloc made a\nresolution to hold an annual caucus within the region to discuss common issues\nfaced and how to respond to them. The idea to have an Eastern Africa Youth\nForum (previously called Eastern Africa Youth Conference) was thus born and\nKenya was honoured with the opportunity to host the first forum in 2011 and\nUganda hosted the second one in 2012.\n\n\nActivities\n\n\n1. Annual EAYF: EAYF aims to annually create a common ground for 90\nyoung people from the 9 Eastern Africa region to come together to discuss and\nbrainstorm on how best to address the common problems facing their countries.\nThe annual common forum is to take place in the different countries on a\nrotational basis and since we had the first one in 2011, the last of these forums\nis expected to take place in the year 2019!\n\n\nAnnual EAYF grogress so far\n\n • February 2011 - Nakuru, Kenya\n • February 2012- Kampala, Uganda\n • February 2013- Kigali, Rwanda\n • February 2014- Bujumbura, Burundi\n • February 2015- South Sudan- Plans underway\n\n\n2. Leadership Forums/Workshops: 'lntegricy Youth Camgaign.': EAYF\nwill host 'Youth Integrity Campaigns' in the 9 countries to empower,\nencourage, capacity build and offer mentorship to young people who are\ncourageous enough to stand up and give ethical leadership and governance in\ntheir society. Every year for next three years (2013-2015), EAYF will run 3-\none week mini workshops in 3 countries for 30 committed young leaders in\neach country hence comprehensively empowering and mentoring 270 young\npeople around Eastern Africa!\n\n\nJustification\n\n\nAs IofC, we believe that, it's time for young leaders to prepare and take up\n"", 
""come. With poor leadership, even the best drafted blue prints and strategies are\ndoomed to fail! This is therefore an opportunity to reflect on the gains made in\nthe region, re-strategize on failed tactics, re-invent new strategies, re-implement\nthem and re-evaluate for the good of the continent.\n\n\nContacts\n\n\nTo contact the EAYF planning team: Email here\n"")"

""we have the strength to do it.\n\nPositive.\n\n   1. Positivity begins with ourselves. Self-confidence starts by finding our inner strength. This inner\n     strength makes us ready to change the world around us.\n   2. We train our minds by learning as much as possible about the world we live in. We read and study\n     purposefully. We look at all angles and consider all views with respect. We absorb information and\n     then check it for accuracy or bias.\n   3. We are honest and reliable.\n   4. We treat everyone with kindness and compassion, especially when we disagree.\n   5. We are positive role models for both the old and the young.\n   6. We each contribute our own special skills to the goal and look for others who can contribute as\n     well. It is together that we form the necessary whole.\n   7.

""We are adding another 1000 to our previously reached goal of 1000!\n\nIn 2019, Kectil launched an initiative called \""1000 Males Campaign\"" on its website. We challenged males\nto stand up to a large leadership role to protect females in their societies.\nWe successfully met the goal with 1000 Male Pledges from more than 72 countries in the world! That is a\nbig milestone for us, and we are so proud to receive messages from Promise Keepers saying how they\nhave been keeping their promises after pledging a year ago.\nWe publicly honor those males who participated and acted as they promised! We have set a new goal\nwhere those who have already pledged can promise again while still inviting others to join!\n\n2000 Male Promise Keepers!!\n\nThe Malmar Knowles Family Foundation and The Kectil Program are excited to announce that the male\npledges portal is now reopened! In 2019, we successfully reached the goal of attaining 1000 pledges with\nthe support of 1000 brave males from 72 countries. We have been motivated to take this legacy up a\nnotch by launching the \""2000 Males Campaign\"". Yes, we have decided to double the goal!\nWith more males involved in protecting females, the communities will indefinitely get better for\neveryone. With that belief, we ask men to stand up and act as \""Promise Keepers\"" to take care of the girls\nand women in their society, to profess their commitment to the females at large, and to protect females\nagainst any forms of violence.\nWe call for males to take the following pledge:\n1. When you see a female you find atractive, you must ask yourself this VERY important question. \""If I am\nwith this female and she gets pregnant, would I be willing to take care of her and the baby with a full\ncommitment?\"" If the answer is no, then put your hands in your pocket and walk away.\n2. I agree not to hit or physically attack a female.\n3. I agree to keep my eyes open as a protector to identify situations in which a female is at risk and will\ntry to take reasonable steps to help if possible.\n4. I will encourage other males to take the Kectil Promise Leaders Pledge.\nIf you have already participated in \""1000 Males Campaign\"", we encourage you to continue the pledge at\nthe website and keep up your mission of protecting females you took up and share the message to other\nmen.\nIf you have not, please do now!\nOne man can't make a change, but together we can definitely bring a better world for our females, girls,\nour future daughters and granddaughters.\n**your signature**\nBCC yourself\n"",

""2.0 RATIONALE FOR THE 2nd AFRICAN YOUTH CONFERENCE ON CLIMATE CHANGE\n(AfriYOCC-2016)\n\nGlobally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.\nThe anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the environmental challenge of climate\nchange is already modifying Africa’s economies and livelihoods, health, social structure,\ninfrastructure and natural systems. Over the years, African youth have proved their potential in\nboth promoting and implementing climate change adaptation projects in their communities.\nTheir innovations have continually been adopted in responding to climate change impacts. This\nis despite various challenges that include low capacity and education, high rates of poverty and\nlack of financial resources. At the same time, African youth have been minimally represented in\nthe respective country policy processes as well as during the UNFCCC climate change\nnegotiations. Above 50% of the African population are the youth. This justifies the urgent need\nfor youth capacity development to respond to climate change and inclusion as key stakeholders\nin policy process and negotiations. AYICC aims to spearhead new innovations, look into new\nsystems of success to share with policy and decision-makers, and generally aim to improve on\nthe current system which is causing long-term and irreversible degradation to our livelihoods –\nas the leading youth organization on climate change in Africa.\n\n\n\n                                                                    O\nIn cognizance of the role and potential of the African youth in climate change mitigation and\nadaptation and overall sustainable development trajectory, the second African Youth\n\n\n\n\n                                                 M\nConference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC), shall be held in Nairobi, Kenya on 10th to 13th\nOctober, 2016 as AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its formation in 2006 during the\nsecond Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12.

Through partnership with both\nGovernmental and Non-governmental agencies, the conference shall not only negotiate for\nmore youth representation in the respective country policy processes towards the forthcoming\nCoPs and country specific policies, but also provide learning and engagement opportunities for\nAfrican youths. This will greatly enhance their current capacity and potential to actively\nparticipate in both national and international platforms for policy formulation and implementation.\nThe conference will also provide a platform to re-assess the current position of our negotiators\nand create awareness about the critical role young people should play in shifting agendas in the\nforthcoming Conference of Parties in Marrakech come November 2016.

""seem insufficient, the conference will pave the way for active engagement of African youth into\nissues affecting their livelihoods.\n\nAfrican youth have for long been side-lined to the periphery of the substantive civic and policy\nissues facing the continent. However, the worst affected are the rural based youths and those\nresiding in farming communities, peri-urban areas and those from conflict and post conflict\ncountries. This has resulted in youths from these marginalized communities having no\nknowledge and information on the basic climate change science and adaptation and mitigation\nmechanisms. The good news though is that there is capacity amongst many young people who\nare already in the circles of upcoming academia, policy specialists, lawyers, journalists and\nscientists’ alike. These capacities need to be strengthened and skills shared amongst the wider\ngroup of young people on the continent so that best practices are disseminated and resources\nare expanded.\n\nWhile it is an undeniable fact that climate change is affecting all regions globally, especially in\ndeveloping countries, the adverse effects in the future is likely to increase if the Paris agreement\nis not ratified and effectuated by all parties. And even though a deal was achieved during\nCOP21 in Paris, the impacts of climate change will definitely continue into the future. This\nsuggests that young people will have to not just understand what climate change is and how it is\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      O\naffecting our world, opportunities that exists within, but most importantly, participate actively into\nfinding amicable solutions.

""3.0 BACKGROUND TO AFRICAN YOUTH INITIATIVE ON CLIMATE CHANGE (AYICC)\n\nThe African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is an umbrella youth network of African\nbased youth organizations, university groups, rural youth groups, schools, and individuals\nworking on climate change and sustainable development issues. It aims at developing capacity\nand strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent need to take action\nagainst the impacts of climate change for both present and future generations.\n\nThe initiative (always referred to as the movement) was conceived in Nairobi Kenya 10 years\nago, during the second Conference of Youth (COY2) preceding the 12th Conference of Parties\nof the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC - COP12). The\nmain reason for its founding was to ensure the inclusion, and active participation of youths from\nthe south, and specifically Africa, in the international climate change negotiations. This was\nneeded as the youth are more than half the African population and are most affected by climate\nchange impacts. They also got massive potential to support the continent to take action on\nglobal warming.\n\nDuring its formation, it comprised of 8 country chapters and current has grown to 45 country\nchapters with over 20,000 members across Africa and the Diaspora. This initiative has provided\n\n\n\n\n                                                                  O\na platform for knowledge, ideas and experiences sharing. It is also an avenue for development\nof skills and strategies on youth action on climate change mitigation and adaptation in the\nAfrican continent. AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a\nplatform for them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the\n\n\n\n\n                                               M\nUNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others.\n\nSince its inception, we have worked in partnership with international youth movements and have\n\n\n\n\n                                             E\nplayed a great role in the establishment of the International Youth Climate Movement whose\nyouth member organizations are now officially acknowledged by the UNFCCC as the YOUNGO\n(Youth NGOs involved in the climate change negotiations process). Since COY2 in Nairobi, it\n\n\n\n\n                                   D\nhas had youth delegates’ representation in all COP meetings.\n\nIn addition to the above, we have had landmark successes that include:\n    \uf0b7 A reach out programme for a children’s home (Watoto Wema in Ruai) and School\n        climate change education program run in selected schools in Kenya.\n    \uf0b7 Leadership and mentorship programmes especially on volunteerism.\n    \uf0b7 Community development projects particularly on clean energy (energy saving stoves for\n        rural folks)\n    \uf0b7 Capacity development of youth on agribusiness\n    \uf0b7 Advocacy campaigns e.g. lobbied for lanes to be set aside along the major highways for\n        non-motorised transport especially for cyclists.\n    \uf0b7 Policy engagements i.e. contributing to the climate change bill 2012,as stakeholders\n    \uf0b7 Youth Caravan from Kenya to Durban during COP 17\n\n\n\n\n                                               9\n"",

To date little has been done to empower, capacitate and mobilise youth, particularly in Africa to address global environmental challenges such as\nclimate change. facebook d o w n ~ To remedy this, an initial step has been the formation of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC).\n\nThe African Youth Initiative on Climate Change was formed partially in response to the poor representation of young Africans at the International Youth\nSummit on Climate Change (November 24-28, 2005), which was held in conjunction with the United Nation's Climate Change Conference (November 28-\nDecember 10, 2005) in Montreal , Canada. The overall mission of AYICC is to ensure that African youth are equipped toparticipate in future UNFCCC\nmeetings and other global initiatives for sustainable solutions to environmental degradation and climate change.\n\nIn order to ensure a strong youth presence in climate change dialogue and fora, there is a need for AYICC to ensure youth representation from various parts\nof Africa. This will enable Africa's youth to engage with the global youth movement, governments and NGO's in a more coordinated and sustained manner.\nThe long term goal is to ensure sustainable and systematic global youth action, with special emphasis on African youth on the issue of climate change.\n\nPresently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any financial assistance. The planning committee members have\nvolunteered their time and their contributions. However, in order to make this vision a reality we need to become a financially viable organisation. For this\nreason, we would like to request your financial assistance in getting this vision off the ground.•\n"",

As youth we have a stake in this future; it is our future.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                 O\nAs the 7th African Development Forum, we have indeed come of age, we are no longer in our childhood stages of determining sustainable development - the\ntime of maturity has arrived. This year is marked as the International Year of Youth and now, more than ever before, the youth are taking a stand. More than\nanyone else, we, the Youth, face unprecedented challenges as a result of global climate change. We also share the responsibility of addressing ii. As a group,\nwe are key moral stakeholders in the international processes treating the most important challenge of our generation. As it is our future, we will be\ndisproportionately affected by the catastrophic impacts of climate change.\n\nAdvocacy and Behavior Change: II is critical for present and future leaders to collaborate on finding solutions. The need for cultural transformation in our time\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              M\nis stronger than ever. This transformation - that enables us to shift towards a more sustainable world - should be an organic process, guided by principles of\ncompassion, integrity and justice. We need to pragmatically rethink our behavioral patterns, to enable a paradigm shift that is based on an ongoing process of\naction, reflection and meaningful participation. Awareness, education and empowerment are fundamental prerequisites to enabling this process, and the youth\nare energetic and passionate about holding governments and all relevant stakeholders involved accountable for their actions. We are equal partners in this\nprocess and commit ourselves fully to achieving the objectives as decided by this Forum.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            E\nContrary to what is believed; young people play a dynamic role in framing and implementing policies. So their role goes beyond advocacy. From an advocacy\nperspective, young people are involved in songs and stories which spread awareness in local languages. Of course we understand the importance and\nrelevance of this because 70% of Africa is based in rural areas and the term Climate Change is foreign, Young people are finding ways of using words in local\nlanguages to translate the message across.\n\n\n\n\n                                                           D\nIt is time to shift the balance of decision-making towards the generation that will have to manage this unwanted inheritance, to make political and economic\ndecisions that can span a generation, and to enable real inter-generational and inter-cultural dialogue about climate change to be realized in institutions where\nthe youth generation can learn.\n\nHowever at the same time a range of social learning and marketing approaches need to be developed to address the gap between classroom education styles\nand education that stimulates real action. This gap prevents the cultural shift from token awareness to personal action and reaction.\n\nEducation: In relation to climate change, African Governments should begin at inception to mainstream youth voices and perceptions. This is particularly\nimportant because climate change projections indicate that effects will begin to be most felt in the next 20-30 years - young people should begin to be part of\nthe solution so that they will be able to cope when disaster calls. Involving them in this programme will ensure that those who will be affected will have direct\nknowledge of the challenges and strategies for coping as well as the ability to mobilize communities to respond to and prepare for the impact of climate change\nand natural disasters.\n\nGovernments must give credence to the higher learning education system in Africa in particular the increased accent on improvement of research and\ninnovation on climate change specifically highlighting on policy and reform, the programmes, pedagogy and teaching tools. This will enhance an equipped pool\nof intellectual capital among the young people on climate change issues who will replicate this to the various organizations and networks that they are part of.\n\nAl government level, during the last Conference of the Parties (COP), ii was pleasing to see that many African delegations included youth and gave them a role\nto play. Furthermore, many youth who were involved in COP 15 deliberations have been interacting with their various governments and engaging in processes\nand procedures that are related to Climate change policy. There is an understanding that more needs to be done, and at this forum, I urge you to engage young\npeople who knock on your doors asking to be involved.\n\nYouth and youth based NGOs play a major role either in strengthening local capacity to cope or by supporting local action. Already, groups such as the Nigerian\nYouth Coalition and the African youth Climate Initiative-Kenya have established school climate clubs, which are creative ways to engage young people; these\ninitiatives should be mainstreamed into education systems. Young people in this governance process are important because successful adaptation requires a\nhost of innovative measures developed with vulnerable communities to improve their present and future livelihoods. Young people are vibrant and are able to\naccess places that many governmental institutions fail to access. As the majority of the population and Africa's future, it is important to include them in this\nimpending crisis that is Climate Change.\n\nAlready, this conference calls for integrated approaches to enable African countries to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change. There is a dire need\nto have a clearer understanding of the potential calamities that climate change can bring and to start the discourse on how best to stave off the worst impacts.\nThere is already an understanding that\n\nClimate Change is not a localized problem but transcends national borders, hence the need for co-operation of Intergovernmental agencies but also to include\nthose young and vulnerable people.\n\nConclusion :\n"", 
""No longer can climate change be seen as merely an environmental problem or an energy challenge. It is a combination of both, which needs the involvement of\nyoung people to preserve the environment and enter into green energy careers.\n\nIt's important for all of us to recognize that sustainable development isn't just a catch phrase - people all over the continent are taking it into their own hands. A\ncouple days ago over 300 community events took place in nearly every country on the continent of Africa, and more than 7000 globally as part of the Global\nWork Party on 10/10/10.\n\nEverywhere in the wortd, people planted trees, cultivated community gardens, installed solar panels, made buildings more efficient and implemented thousands\nof other grassroots solutions to the climate crisis.

""The 25th session of the Conference Parties (COP25) to the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held from the 2 -13\nDecember bringing together nearly 27000 people to the Spanish capital.

Youth have a pivotal role to play in the\nimplementation of ACE which consists of six elements namely: education,\ntraining, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and\ninternational cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n                             D\nAt COP25, the Intergenerational Inquiry which is a highlight event of Young and\nFuture Generations Day and like every year provided a platform for youth and\ndecision-makers to discuss how young people can enhance the implementation\nof the Paris Agreement. This platform was attended by the Executive Secretary of\nthe UNFCCC and provided an opportunity for young people to share the\noutcome on the Conference of Youth (COY 15) to the secretariat.\n\n\nThe African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) has continued to\nempower and mobilize young people at COP through our side events and\nexhibitions. Through an exhibition at COP 25, AYICC was able to showcase the\nactions and contributions of African youth in the fight against climate change.\nSuch actions include ecological restorations, renewable energy promotion, and\nlocal conference of youth hosted by our national chapters.\n\n\nAYICC's greatest concern however, is with regards to the low representation of\nAfrican youth at the UNFCCC sessions. There are many contributing factors which\nincludes lack of funding, inability to assess accreditations and visas. As the first\nstep in addressing this, we will continue to encourage African countries to make\nconscious efforts to include youth delegates in their official delegations for COPs.\nWe also call on development partners and stakeholders who are interested in\nyouth development to reach out with their support to AYICC to enhance African\nyouth participation in this important global process.\n"",

""The African Youth Initiative on\nClimate Change\n\n\n• Campaigns and Advocacy\n The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is widely known for our\n incessant campaigns and research-based advocacy on environmental and\n climate change topics. Since 2006 AYICC has been consistent with its\n campaigns impressing on African governments and international community\n alike to deliver on their commitment under the United Nations Framework\n Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) .\n\n\n\n• Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)\n Climate change education, training, and awareness creation have been the\n central focus of AYICC targeting youth and vulnerable communities. We do\n this through workshops, conferences, and webinars leveraging on our robust\n online presence. Through our Flagship program; the African Youth Conference\n on Climate Change (AFRIYOCC) we are able to provide a platform for\n\n\n\n\n                                                                     O\n exchange of ideas and sharing of knowledge and best practices among young\n African thereby feeding into article 6 of the climate change convention and\n article 12 of the Paris Agreement.\n\n\n\n• Tree planting and Ecological restoration\n\n\n\n                                         M\n Trees contribute to their environment by providing oxygen, improving air\n quality, climate amelioration, conserving water, preserving soil, and\n\n\n\n\n                                       E\n supporting wildlife. Beyond the campaigns and advocacies, our member\n organizations embark on tree planting and reforestation activities including\n mangrove restoration along the coast.\n\n\n\n\n                         D\n• Renewable energy promotion\n With the increasing demand for energy for industrial and economic\n development, AYICC member organizations in different countries are\n promoting renewable energy access to isolated off-grid communities. AYICC\n believes that Youth-led renewable energy enterprises are a viable means of\n achieving sustainable development, as they promote technologies that are\n less harmful to the global environs while at the same time providing\n sustainable income-generating opportunities for youth .\n\n\n\n• Youth in Agribusiness\n AYICC sees agriculture as an essential driver of economic development and an\n area of great opportunity for young people in Africa. The challenge, however,\n is that the growing youth population does not see agriculture as a profitable\n opportunity due to their lack of insight into the opportunities that exist within\n the agriculture value chain. Through our member organizations who are youth\n farmers themselves, AYICC has adopted various strategies including outreach\n to schools and communities, exhibitions and youth agricultural festivals as\n well as institution of award schemes for best youth farmers as a way to raise\n interest and awareness on the opportunities that exist within this sector.\n\n\n\n• Recycling\n"", 
""                            Over recent years, the world has witnessed an increasing level of waste\n                            products as a by-product of the increasing level of population, affluence, and\n                            technological advancement in a given environment or society. In Africa we\n                            have witnessed increasing level of pollution from plastic, car tires, bottles\n                            among others and this has generated innovative thinking among young\n                            people to provide a sustainable solution. Over the years, AYICC members have\n                            redefined waste as a resource for sustainable development and through\n                            various recycling initiatives, they are bringing life into materials that otherwise\n                            could have been a nuisance to the environment.\n\n\n\n\nAVLS143_The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change_Article\nSourceURL: http:llwww.ayicc.africa/national-chapter.php\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  O\n                                                                   E M\n                     Deon Shekuza\n                                Namibia\n                                                          D                  ISSA Garba\n                                                                                     Niger\n                                                                                                                  Chinedu Felix\n                                                                                                                     Opara\n                                                                                                                      Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n                      Jean-betrand                                       ARODOKOUN                                Phillip Mfolo\n                        Mhandu                                           Adona·i Ulrich                               Botswana\n\n                               Zimbabwe                                              Benin\n"",
