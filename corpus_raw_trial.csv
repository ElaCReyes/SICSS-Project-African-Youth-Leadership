The 1st African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) convened from 26th - 27th
October, 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, on the theme “African Youth Responses to Climate
Change and Food Security, Action from the Frontline.” The conference was organized by Africa
Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) in partnership with Africa Climate Policy Center
(ACPC), New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), Pan African Climate Justice
Alliance (PACJA) and Zimbabwe United Nations Association (ZUNA).
100 youths selected across Africa in the conference addressing the thematic strands of Youth in
Agribusiness; Climate Change and Development in Africa; Sustainable Agriculture and Food
Security; Green Economy and Technology Transfer; Climate Justice and Human Rights; and
Climate Change and Disaster risk reduction participated in this first edition of the African Youth
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC). This came at a time when Africa as a continent
continues to bear the biggest brunt of climate change due to low resilience and weak capacities,
with the youth despite their huge numbers and innovativeness among the vulnerable alongside
women. Despite the odds, they have been actively engaged in adaptation and mitigation




                                                                   O
initiatives that improve their communities’ resilience to climate change.
The conference therefore provided a platform for the African youths to interact and share best
practices. Five flagship projects were selected to be used as case studies by African Youths in
starting their own projects depending on transferability. The conference also saw the drafting of




                                                M
African youth position for COP 21 which was handed over to African Group of Negotiators at the
fifth Climate Change and Development in Africa Conference (CCDA V).

(AfriYOCC-2016)

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the environmental challenge of climate
change is already modifying Africa’s economies and livelihoods, health, social structure,
infrastructure and natural systems. Over the years, African youth have proved their potential in
both promoting and implementing climate change adaptation projects in their communities.
Their innovations have continually been adopted in responding to climate change impacts. This
is despite various challenges that include low capacity and education, high rates of poverty and
lack of financial resources. At the same time, African youth have been minimally represented in
the respective country policy processes as well as during the UNFCCC climate change
negotiations. Above 50% of the African population are the youth. This justifies the urgent need
for youth capacity development to respond to climate change and inclusion as key stakeholders
in policy process and negotiations. AYICC aims to spearhead new innovations, look into new
systems of success to share with policy and decision-makers, and generally aim to improve on
the current system which is causing long-term and irreversible degradation to our livelihoods –
as the leading youth organization on climate change in Africa.



                                                                    O
In cognizance of the role and potential of the African youth in climate change mitigation and
adaptation and overall sustainable development trajectory, the second African Youth




                                                 M
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC), shall be held in Nairobi, Kenya on 10th to 13th
October, 2016 as AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its formation in 2006 during the
second Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12. Building on the success of the first




                                               E
edition of conference, AfriYOCC shall provide an avenue for African youths to showcase their
climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, projects and initiatives. Best practices
arising from the various AYICC country chapters shall be developed to an African youth




                                    D
climate change adaptation and mitigation best practices database and handbook. The
meeting will dilate on the current post 2015 development agenda and the role of young
people in championing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in
Africa.

The delegates shall have an opportunity to visit ongoing Climate Change adaptation and
agribusiness projects in Kenya for hands-on skills and knowledge replicable in their countries.
Consequently, it shall boost the skills and capacities of African youths to substantially contribute
to the process leading towards and during COP 22. Through partnership with both
Governmental and Non-governmental agencies, the conference shall not only negotiate for
more youth representation in the respective country policy processes towards the forthcoming
CoPs and country specific policies, but also provide learning and engagement opportunities for
African youths. This will greatly enhance their current capacity and potential to actively
participate in both national and international platforms for policy formulation and implementation.
The conference will also provide a platform to re-assess the current position of our negotiators
and create awareness about the critical role young people should play in shifting agendas in the
forthcoming Conference of Parties in Marrakech come November 2016. While a 4 day gathering

issues affecting their livelihoods.

African youth have for long been side-lined to the periphery of the substantive civic and policy
issues facing the continent. However, the worst affected are the rural based youths and those
residing in farming communities, peri-urban areas and those from conflict and post conflict
countries. This has resulted in youths from these marginalized communities having no
knowledge and information on the basic climate change science and adaptation and mitigation
mechanisms. The good news though is that there is capacity amongst many young people who
are already in the circles of upcoming academia, policy specialists, lawyers, journalists and
scientists’ alike. These capacities need to be strengthened and skills shared amongst the wider
group of young people on the continent so that best practices are disseminated and resources
are expanded.

While it is an undeniable fact that climate change is affecting all regions globally, especially in
developing countries, the adverse effects in the future is likely to increase if the Paris agreement
is not ratified and effectuated by all parties. And even though a deal was achieved during
COP21 in Paris, the impacts of climate change will definitely continue into the future. This
suggests that young people will have to not just understand what climate change is and how it is




                                                                      O
affecting our world, opportunities that exists within, but most importantly, participate actively into
finding amicable solutions. Young people of Africa have therefore considered it an inherent
imperative to contribute to their future by organizing the 2nd African Youth Conference on
Climate Change in October 2016 under the theme, ‘Making Climate Finance work for




                                                  M
African Youth.’


2.1 CONFERENCE STRATEGY




                                                E
The conference program shall be based on exploring mechanisms to finance climate adaptation
and mitigation through Innovations in agriculture, technology and other sectors. It shall be




                                     D
highly interactive with unique workshop-style design that enables participants to develop their
potential through practical experience. Participants will divide to participate in thematic
workshops and come up with an African Youth position paper and concrete activities to be
included in the African Youth Strategy on Climate Change.

The delegates shall be engaged in pre-conference activities that shall include and not limited to,
mapping of youth climate change and/or mitigation projects within the conference key focus
areas for selection as best practice and include in the African youth climate change adaptation
and mitigation best practices database and handbook and aggressively fundraise towards their
participation and a successful workshop. The conference shall critically examine the various
country positions and the overall continents positions of the African Group of Negotiators, their
achievements and potentials towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It shall
examine the youth voices in these positions and further develop African youth position for
COP22.

We expect 200 youth leaders to participate in this conference. The conference is convened by
the AYICC continental secretariat in collaboration with AYICC Kenya chapter and the member

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is an umbrella youth network of African
based youth organizations, university groups, rural youth groups, schools, and individuals
working on climate change and sustainable development issues. It aims at developing capacity
and strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent need to take action
against the impacts of climate change for both present and future generations.

The initiative (always referred to as the movement) was conceived in Nairobi Kenya 10 years
ago, during the second Conference of Youth (COY2) preceding the 12th Conference of Parties
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC - COP12). The
main reason for its founding was to ensure the inclusion, and active participation of youths from
the south, and specifically Africa, in the international climate change negotiations. This was
needed as the youth are more than half the African population and are most affected by climate
change impacts. They also got massive potential to support the continent to take action on
global warming.

During its formation, it comprised of 8 country chapters and current has grown to 45 country
chapters with over 20,000 members across Africa and the Diaspora. This initiative has provided




                                                                  O
a platform for knowledge, ideas and experiences sharing. It is also an avenue for development
of skills and strategies on youth action on climate change mitigation and adaptation in the
African continent. AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a
platform for them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the




                                               M
UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others.

Since its inception, we have worked in partnership with international youth movements and have




                                             E
played a great role in the establishment of the International Youth Climate Movement whose
youth member organizations are now officially acknowledged by the UNFCCC as the YOUNGO
(Youth NGOs involved in the climate change negotiations process). Since COY2 in Nairobi, it




                                   D
has had youth delegates’ representation in all COP meetings.

In addition to the above, we have had landmark successes that include:
     A reach out programme for a children’s home (Watoto Wema in Ruai) and School
        climate change education program run in selected schools in Kenya.
     Leadership and mentorship programmes especially on volunteerism.
     Community development projects particularly on clean energy (energy saving stoves for
        rural folks)
     Capacity development of youth on agribusiness
     Advocacy campaigns e.g. lobbied for lanes to be set aside along the major highways for
        non-motorised transport especially for cyclists.
     Policy engagements i.e. contributing to the climate change bill 2012,as stakeholders
     Youth Caravan from Kenya to Durban during COP 17

African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) www.ayicc.net is a continental youth network that was conceived in 2006 in Nairobi Kenya, during the
Conference of Youth held just before the UNFCCC COP12. This initiative has continued to link, and share knowledge, ideas, experiences, skills and strategies
on youth action around the continent on climate change, its mitigation and adaptation and sustainable development. In 2009, AYICC was granted observer
status to the African Minister Conference on Environment (AMCEN). AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a platform for
them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the Conference of Parties of UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others. AYICC
currently operates in over 45 African countries with over 20,000 members.

In response, to the call by AU Heads of Sates and Government to establish the CAHOSCC Youth Programme on Climate Change (CYPCC),

Founding Opportunities


AYICC Founding Opportunities

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the
environmental challenge of climate change will ultimately modify Africa's economies and livelihoods, health, social structure, infrastructure and natural
systems. To date little has been done to empower, capacitate and mobilise youth, particularly in Africa to address global environmental challenges such as
climate change. facebook d o w n ~ To remedy this, an initial step has been the formation of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC).

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change was formed partially in response to the poor representation of young Africans at the International Youth
Summit on Climate Change (November 24-28, 2005), which was held in conjunction with the United Nation's Climate Change Conference (November 28-
December 10, 2005) in Montreal , Canada. The overall mission of AYICC is to ensure that African youth are equipped toparticipate in future UNFCCC
meetings and other global initiatives for sustainable solutions to environmental degradation and climate change.

In order to ensure a strong youth presence in climate change dialogue and fora, there is a need for AYICC to ensure youth representation from various parts
of Africa. This will enable Africa's youth to engage with the global youth movement, governments and NGO's in a more coordinated and sustained manner.
The long term goal is to ensure sustainable and systematic global youth action, with special emphasis on African youth on the issue of climate change.

Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any financial assistance. The planning committee members have
volunteered their time and their contributions. However, in order to make this vision a reality we need to become a financially viable organisation. For this
reason, we would like to request your financial assistance in getting this vision off the ground.•

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE OPENING FORUM OF THE SEVENTH AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FORUM, 12TH OCTOBER

2010: Ms. Esther Agbarakwe, Nigeria




The Chair,

Climate Change poses significant challenges to future generations. As youth we have a stake in this future; it is our future.




                                                                                                                 O
As the 7th African Development Forum, we have indeed come of age, we are no longer in our childhood stages of determining sustainable development - the
time of maturity has arrived. This year is marked as the International Year of Youth and now, more than ever before, the youth are taking a stand. More than
anyone else, we, the Youth, face unprecedented challenges as a result of global climate change. We also share the responsibility of addressing ii. As a group,
we are key moral stakeholders in the international processes treating the most important challenge of our generation. As it is our future, we will be
disproportionately affected by the catastrophic impacts of climate change.

Advocacy and Behavior Change: II is critical for present and future leaders to collaborate on finding solutions. The need for cultural transformation in our time




                                                                              M
is stronger than ever. This transformation - that enables us to shift towards a more sustainable world - should be an organic process, guided by principles of
compassion, integrity and justice. We need to pragmatically rethink our behavioral patterns, to enable a paradigm shift that is based on an ongoing process of
action, reflection and meaningful participation. Awareness, education and empowerment are fundamental prerequisites to enabling this process, and the youth
are energetic and passionate about holding governments and all relevant stakeholders involved accountable for their actions. We are equal partners in this
process and commit ourselves fully to achieving the objectives as decided by this Forum.




                                                                            E
Contrary to what is believed; young people play a dynamic role in framing and implementing policies. So their role goes beyond advocacy. From an advocacy
perspective, young people are involved in songs and stories which spread awareness in local languages. Of course we understand the importance and
relevance of this because 70% of Africa is based in rural areas and the term Climate Change is foreign, Young people are finding ways of using words in local
languages to translate the message across.




                                                           D
It is time to shift the balance of decision-making towards the generation that will have to manage this unwanted inheritance, to make political and economic
decisions that can span a generation, and to enable real inter-generational and inter-cultural dialogue about climate change to be realized in institutions where
the youth generation can learn.

However at the same time a range of social learning and marketing approaches need to be developed to address the gap between classroom education styles
and education that stimulates real action. This gap prevents the cultural shift from token awareness to personal action and reaction.

Education: In relation to climate change, African Governments should begin at inception to mainstream youth voices and perceptions. This is particularly
important because climate change projections indicate that effects will begin to be most felt in the next 20-30 years - young people should begin to be part of
the solution so that they will be able to cope when disaster calls. Involving them in this programme will ensure that those who will be affected will have direct
knowledge of the challenges and strategies for coping as well as the ability to mobilize communities to respond to and prepare for the impact of climate change
and natural disasters.

Governments must give credence to the higher learning education system in Africa in particular the increased accent on improvement of research and
innovation on climate change specifically highlighting on policy and reform, the programmes, pedagogy and teaching tools. This will enhance an equipped pool
of intellectual capital among the young people on climate change issues who will replicate this to the various organizations and networks that they are part of.

Al government level, during the last Conference of the Parties (COP), ii was pleasing to see that many African delegations included youth and gave them a role
to play. Furthermore, many youth who were involved in COP 15 deliberations have been interacting with their various governments and engaging in processes
and procedures that are related to Climate change policy. There is an understanding that more needs to be done, and at this forum, I urge you to engage young
people who knock on your doors asking to be involved.

Youth and youth based NGOs play a major role either in strengthening local capacity to cope or by supporting local action. Already, groups such as the Nigerian
Youth Coalition and the African youth Climate Initiative-Kenya have established school climate clubs, which are creative ways to engage young people; these
initiatives should be mainstreamed into education systems. Young people in this governance process are important because successful adaptation requires a
host of innovative measures developed with vulnerable communities to improve their present and future livelihoods. Young people are vibrant and are able to
access places that many governmental institutions fail to access. As the majority of the population and Africa's future, it is important to include them in this
impending crisis that is Climate Change.

Already, this conference calls for integrated approaches to enable African countries to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change. There is a dire need
to have a clearer understanding of the potential calamities that climate change can bring and to start the discourse on how best to stave off the worst impacts.
There is already an understanding that

Climate Change is not a localized problem but transcends national borders, hence the need for co-operation of Intergovernmental agencies but also to include
those young and vulnerable people.

Conclusion :
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYL0S23_Bridge2Rwanda","No longer can climate change be seen as merely an environmental problem or an energy challenge. It is a combination of both, which needs the involvement of
young people to preserve the environment and enter into green energy careers.

It's important for all of us to recognize that sustainable development isn't just a catch phrase - people all over the continent are taking it into their own hands. A
couple days ago over 300 community events took place in nearly every country on the continent of Africa, and more than 7000 globally as part of the Global
Work Party on 10/10/10.

Everywhere in the wortd, people planted trees, cultivated community gardens, installed solar panels, made buildings more efficient and implemented thousands
of other grassroots solutions to the climate crisis. We got to work everywhere in the world, but we need you, leaders, to get to work, too.

Thank you and God bless

                                             M
increasingly becoming the centre of discussion.


The world today is home to the largest generation of young people in history and
their energy, creativity, and innovation, when harnessed properly, will accelerate




                                           E
sustainable solutions to the global crisis. Youth have a pivotal role to play in the
implementation of ACE which consists of six elements namely: education,
training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and
international cooperation.




                             D
At COP25, the Intergenerational Inquiry which is a highlight event of Young and
Future Generations Day and like every year provided a platform for youth and
decision-makers to discuss how young people can enhance the implementation
of the Paris Agreement. This platform was attended by the Executive Secretary of
the UNFCCC and provided an opportunity for young people to share the
outcome on the Conference of Youth (COY 15) to the secretariat.


The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) has continued to
empower and mobilize young people at COP through our side events and
exhibitions. Through an exhibition at COP 25, AYICC was able to showcase the
actions and contributions of African youth in the fight against climate change.
Such actions include ecological restorations, renewable energy promotion, and
local conference of youth hosted by our national chapters.


AYICC's greatest concern however, is with regards to the low representation of
African youth at the UNFCCC sessions. There are many contributing factors which
includes lack of funding, inability to assess accreditations and visas. As the first
step in addressing this, we will continue to encourage African countries to make
conscious efforts to include youth delegates in their official delegations for COPs.
We also call on development partners and stakeholders who are interested in
youth development to reach out with their support to AYICC to enhance African
youth participation in this important global process.

Climate Change


• Campaigns and Advocacy
 The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is widely known for our
 incessant campaigns and research-based advocacy on environmental and
 climate change topics. Since 2006 AYICC has been consistent with its
 campaigns impressing on African governments and international community
 alike to deliver on their commitment under the United Nations Framework
 Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) .



• Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)
 Climate change education, training, and awareness creation have been the
 central focus of AYICC targeting youth and vulnerable communities. We do
 this through workshops, conferences, and webinars leveraging on our robust
 online presence. Through our Flagship program; the African Youth Conference
 on Climate Change (AFRIYOCC) we are able to provide a platform for




                                                                     O
 exchange of ideas and sharing of knowledge and best practices among young
 African thereby feeding into article 6 of the climate change convention and
 article 12 of the Paris Agreement.



• Tree planting and Ecological restoration



                                         M
 Trees contribute to their environment by providing oxygen, improving air
 quality, climate amelioration, conserving water, preserving soil, and




                                       E
 supporting wildlife. Beyond the campaigns and advocacies, our member
 organizations embark on tree planting and reforestation activities including
 mangrove restoration along the coast.




                         D
• Renewable energy promotion
 With the increasing demand for energy for industrial and economic
 development, AYICC member organizations in different countries are
 promoting renewable energy access to isolated off-grid communities. AYICC
 believes that Youth-led renewable energy enterprises are a viable means of
 achieving sustainable development, as they promote technologies that are
 less harmful to the global environs while at the same time providing
 sustainable income-generating opportunities for youth .



• Youth in Agribusiness
 AYICC sees agriculture as an essential driver of economic development and an
 area of great opportunity for young people in Africa. The challenge, however,
 is that the growing youth population does not see agriculture as a profitable
 opportunity due to their lack of insight into the opportunities that exist within
 the agriculture value chain. Through our member organizations who are youth
 farmers themselves, AYICC has adopted various strategies including outreach
 to schools and communities, exhibitions and youth agricultural festivals as
 well as institution of award schemes for best youth farmers as a way to raise
 interest and awareness on the opportunities that exist within this sector.



• Recycling
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYL0S23_Bridge2Rwanda","                            Over recent years, the world has witnessed an increasing level of waste
                            products as a by-product of the increasing level of population, affluence, and
                            technological advancement in a given environment or society. In Africa we
                            have witnessed increasing level of pollution from plastic, car tires, bottles
                            among others and this has generated innovative thinking among young
                            people to provide a sustainable solution. Over the years, AYICC members have
                            redefined waste as a resource for sustainable development and through
                            various recycling initiatives, they are bringing life into materials that otherwise
                            could have been a nuisance to the environment.

The 1st African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) convened from 26th - 27th
October, 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, on the theme “African Youth Responses to Climate
Change and Food Security, Action from the Frontline.” The conference was organized by Africa
Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) in partnership with Africa Climate Policy Center
(ACPC), New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), Pan African Climate Justice
Alliance (PACJA) and Zimbabwe United Nations Association (ZUNA).
100 youths selected across Africa in the conference addressing the thematic strands of Youth in
Agribusiness; Climate Change and Development in Africa; Sustainable Agriculture and Food
Security; Green Economy and Technology Transfer; Climate Justice and Human Rights; and
Climate Change and Disaster risk reduction participated in this first edition of the African Youth
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC). This came at a time when Africa as a continent
continues to bear the biggest brunt of climate change due to low resilience and weak capacities,
with the youth despite their huge numbers and innovativeness among the vulnerable alongside
women. Despite the odds, they have been actively engaged in adaptation and mitigation




                                                                   O
initiatives that improve their communities’ resilience to climate change.
The conference therefore provided a platform for the African youths to interact and share best
practices. Five flagship projects were selected to be used as case studies by African Youths in
starting their own projects depending on transferability. The conference also saw the drafting of




                                                M
African youth position for COP 21 which was handed over to African Group of Negotiators at the
fifth Climate Change and Development in Africa Conference (CCDA V).

(AfriYOCC-2016)

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the environmental challenge of climate
change is already modifying Africa’s economies and livelihoods, health, social structure,
infrastructure and natural systems. Over the years, African youth have proved their potential in
both promoting and implementing climate change adaptation projects in their communities.
Their innovations have continually been adopted in responding to climate change impacts. This
is despite various challenges that include low capacity and education, high rates of poverty and
lack of financial resources. At the same time, African youth have been minimally represented in
the respective country policy processes as well as during the UNFCCC climate change
negotiations. Above 50% of the African population are the youth. This justifies the urgent need
for youth capacity development to respond to climate change and inclusion as key stakeholders
in policy process and negotiations. AYICC aims to spearhead new innovations, look into new
systems of success to share with policy and decision-makers, and generally aim to improve on
the current system which is causing long-term and irreversible degradation to our livelihoods –
as the leading youth organization on climate change in Africa.



                                                                    O
In cognizance of the role and potential of the African youth in climate change mitigation and
adaptation and overall sustainable development trajectory, the second African Youth




                                                 M
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC), shall be held in Nairobi, Kenya on 10th to 13th
October, 2016 as AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its formation in 2006 during the
second Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12. Building on the success of the first




                                               E
edition of conference, AfriYOCC shall provide an avenue for African youths to showcase their
climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, projects and initiatives. Best practices
arising from the various AYICC country chapters shall be developed to an African youth




                                    D
climate change adaptation and mitigation best practices database and handbook. The
meeting will dilate on the current post 2015 development agenda and the role of young
people in championing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in
Africa.

The delegates shall have an opportunity to visit ongoing Climate Change adaptation and
agribusiness projects in Kenya for hands-on skills and knowledge replicable in their countries.
Consequently, it shall boost the skills and capacities of African youths to substantially contribute
to the process leading towards and during COP 22. Through partnership with both
Governmental and Non-governmental agencies, the conference shall not only negotiate for
more youth representation in the respective country policy processes towards the forthcoming
CoPs and country specific policies, but also provide learning and engagement opportunities for
African youths. This will greatly enhance their current capacity and potential to actively
participate in both national and international platforms for policy formulation and implementation.
The conference will also provide a platform to re-assess the current position of our negotiators
and create awareness about the critical role young people should play in shifting agendas in the
forthcoming Conference of Parties in Marrakech come November 2016. While a 4 day gathering

"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS001_ALA","seem insufficient, the conference will pave the way for active engagement of African youth into
issues affecting their livelihoods.

African youth have for long been side-lined to the periphery of the substantive civic and policy
issues facing the continent. However, the worst affected are the rural based youths and those
residing in farming communities, peri-urban areas and those from conflict and post conflict
countries. This has resulted in youths from these marginalized communities having no
knowledge and information on the basic climate change science and adaptation and mitigation
mechanisms. The good news though is that there is capacity amongst many young people who
are already in the circles of upcoming academia, policy specialists, lawyers, journalists and
scientists’ alike. These capacities need to be strengthened and skills shared amongst the wider
group of young people on the continent so that best practices are disseminated and resources
are expanded.

While it is an undeniable fact that climate change is affecting all regions globally, especially in
developing countries, the adverse effects in the future is likely to increase if the Paris agreement
is not ratified and effectuated by all parties. And even though a deal was achieved during
COP21 in Paris, the impacts of climate change will definitely continue into the future. This
suggests that young people will have to not just understand what climate change is and how it is




                                                                      O
affecting our world, opportunities that exists within, but most importantly, participate actively into
finding amicable solutions. Young people of Africa have therefore considered it an inherent
imperative to contribute to their future by organizing the 2nd African Youth Conference on
Climate Change in October 2016 under the theme, ‘Making Climate Finance work for




                                                  M
African Youth.’


2.1 CONFERENCE STRATEGY




                                                E
The conference program shall be based on exploring mechanisms to finance climate adaptation
and mitigation through Innovations in agriculture, technology and other sectors. It shall be




                                     D
highly interactive with unique workshop-style design that enables participants to develop their
potential through practical experience. Participants will divide to participate in thematic
workshops and come up with an African Youth position paper and concrete activities to be
included in the African Youth Strategy on Climate Change.

The delegates shall be engaged in pre-conference activities that shall include and not limited to,
mapping of youth climate change and/or mitigation projects within the conference key focus
areas for selection as best practice and include in the African youth climate change adaptation
and mitigation best practices database and handbook and aggressively fundraise towards their
participation and a successful workshop. The conference shall critically examine the various
country positions and the overall continents positions of the African Group of Negotiators, their
achievements and potentials towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It shall
examine the youth voices in these positions and further develop African youth position for
COP22.

We expect 200 youth leaders to participate in this conference. The conference is convened by
the AYICC continental secretariat in collaboration with AYICC Kenya chapter and the member

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is an umbrella youth network of African
based youth organizations, university groups, rural youth groups, schools, and individuals
working on climate change and sustainable development issues. It aims at developing capacity
and strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent need to take action
against the impacts of climate change for both present and future generations.

The initiative (always referred to as the movement) was conceived in Nairobi Kenya 10 years
ago, during the second Conference of Youth (COY2) preceding the 12th Conference of Parties
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC - COP12). The
main reason for its founding was to ensure the inclusion, and active participation of youths from
the south, and specifically Africa, in the international climate change negotiations. This was
needed as the youth are more than half the African population and are most affected by climate
change impacts. They also got massive potential to support the continent to take action on
global warming.

During its formation, it comprised of 8 country chapters and current has grown to 45 country
chapters with over 20,000 members across Africa and the Diaspora. This initiative has provided




                                                                  O
a platform for knowledge, ideas and experiences sharing. It is also an avenue for development
of skills and strategies on youth action on climate change mitigation and adaptation in the
African continent. AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a
platform for them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the




                                               M
UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others.

Since its inception, we have worked in partnership with international youth movements and have




                                             E
played a great role in the establishment of the International Youth Climate Movement whose
youth member organizations are now officially acknowledged by the UNFCCC as the YOUNGO
(Youth NGOs involved in the climate change negotiations process). Since COY2 in Nairobi, it




                                   D
has had youth delegates’ representation in all COP meetings.

In addition to the above, we have had landmark successes that include:
     A reach out programme for a children’s home (Watoto Wema in Ruai) and School
        climate change education program run in selected schools in Kenya.
     Leadership and mentorship programmes especially on volunteerism.
     Community development projects particularly on clean energy (energy saving stoves for
        rural folks)
     Capacity development of youth on agribusiness
     Advocacy campaigns e.g. lobbied for lanes to be set aside along the major highways for
        non-motorised transport especially for cyclists.
     Policy engagements i.e. contributing to the climate change bill 2012,as stakeholders
     Youth Caravan from Kenya to Durban during COP 17

African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) 2016

African Youth Conference on Climate Change will take place in Nairobi in Kenya. The conference is organized by the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change
(AYICC) and the African Climate Policy Centre from the 10 to 13 October 2016. AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its fonmation in 2006 during the second
Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12.

African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) www.ayicc.net is a continental youth network that was conceived in 2006 in Nairobi Kenya, during the
Conference of Youth held just before the UNFCCC COP12. This initiative has continued to link, and share knowledge, ideas, experiences, skills and strategies
on youth action around the continent on climate change, its mitigation and adaptation and sustainable development. In 2009, AYICC was granted observer
status to the African Minister Conference on Environment (AMCEN). AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a platform for
them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the Conference of Parties of UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others. AYICC
currently operates in over 45 African countries with over 20,000 members.

In response, to the call by AU Heads of Sates and Government to establish the CAHOSCC Youth Programme on Climate Change (CYPCC),

Founding Opportunities


AYICC Founding Opportunities

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the
environmental challenge of climate change will ultimately modify Africa's economies and livelihoods, health, social structure, infrastructure and natural
systems. To date little has been done to empower, capacitate and mobilise youth, particularly in Africa to address global environmental challenges such as
climate change. facebook d o w n ~ To remedy this, an initial step has been the formation of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC).

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change was formed partially in response to the poor representation of young Africans at the International Youth
Summit on Climate Change (November 24-28, 2005), which was held in conjunction with the United Nation's Climate Change Conference (November 28-
December 10, 2005) in Montreal , Canada. The overall mission of AYICC is to ensure that African youth are equipped toparticipate in future UNFCCC
meetings and other global initiatives for sustainable solutions to environmental degradation and climate change.

In order to ensure a strong youth presence in climate change dialogue and fora, there is a need for AYICC to ensure youth representation from various parts
of Africa. This will enable Africa's youth to engage with the global youth movement, governments and NGO's in a more coordinated and sustained manner.
The long term goal is to ensure sustainable and systematic global youth action, with special emphasis on African youth on the issue of climate change.

Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any financial assistance. The planning committee members have
volunteered their time and their contributions. However, in order to make this vision a reality we need to become a financially viable organisation. For this
reason, we would like to request your financial assistance in getting this vision off the ground.•

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE ADF 7 OPENING FORUM, 12TH OCT.10

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE OPENING FORUM OF THE SEVENTH AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FORUM, 12TH OCTOBER

2010: Ms. Esther Agbarakwe, Nigeria




The Chair,

Climate Change poses significant challenges to future generations. As youth we have a stake in this future; it is our future.




                                                                                                                 O
As the 7th African Development Forum, we have indeed come of age, we are no longer in our childhood stages of determining sustainable development - the
time of maturity has arrived. This year is marked as the International Year of Youth and now, more than ever before, the youth are taking a stand. More than
anyone else, we, the Youth, face unprecedented challenges as a result of global climate change. We also share the responsibility of addressing ii. As a group,
we are key moral stakeholders in the international processes treating the most important challenge of our generation. As it is our future, we will be
disproportionately affected by the catastrophic impacts of climate change.

Advocacy and Behavior Change: II is critical for present and future leaders to collaborate on finding solutions. The need for cultural transformation in our time




                                                                              M
is stronger than ever. This transformation - that enables us to shift towards a more sustainable world - should be an organic process, guided by principles of
compassion, integrity and justice. We need to pragmatically rethink our behavioral patterns, to enable a paradigm shift that is based on an ongoing process of
action, reflection and meaningful participation. Awareness, education and empowerment are fundamental prerequisites to enabling this process, and the youth
are energetic and passionate about holding governments and all relevant stakeholders involved accountable for their actions. We are equal partners in this
process and commit ourselves fully to achieving the objectives as decided by this Forum.




                                                                            E
Contrary to what is believed; young people play a dynamic role in framing and implementing policies. So their role goes beyond advocacy. From an advocacy
perspective, young people are involved in songs and stories which spread awareness in local languages. Of course we understand the importance and
relevance of this because 70% of Africa is based in rural areas and the term Climate Change is foreign, Young people are finding ways of using words in local
languages to translate the message across.




                                                           D
It is time to shift the balance of decision-making towards the generation that will have to manage this unwanted inheritance, to make political and economic
decisions that can span a generation, and to enable real inter-generational and inter-cultural dialogue about climate change to be realized in institutions where
the youth generation can learn.

However at the same time a range of social learning and marketing approaches need to be developed to address the gap between classroom education styles
and education that stimulates real action. This gap prevents the cultural shift from token awareness to personal action and reaction.

Education: In relation to climate change, African Governments should begin at inception to mainstream youth voices and perceptions. This is particularly
important because climate change projections indicate that effects will begin to be most felt in the next 20-30 years - young people should begin to be part of
the solution so that they will be able to cope when disaster calls. Involving them in this programme will ensure that those who will be affected will have direct
knowledge of the challenges and strategies for coping as well as the ability to mobilize communities to respond to and prepare for the impact of climate change
and natural disasters.

Governments must give credence to the higher learning education system in Africa in particular the increased accent on improvement of research and
innovation on climate change specifically highlighting on policy and reform, the programmes, pedagogy and teaching tools. This will enhance an equipped pool
of intellectual capital among the young people on climate change issues who will replicate this to the various organizations and networks that they are part of.

Al government level, during the last Conference of the Parties (COP), ii was pleasing to see that many African delegations included youth and gave them a role
to play. Furthermore, many youth who were involved in COP 15 deliberations have been interacting with their various governments and engaging in processes
and procedures that are related to Climate change policy. There is an understanding that more needs to be done, and at this forum, I urge you to engage young
people who knock on your doors asking to be involved.

Youth and youth based NGOs play a major role either in strengthening local capacity to cope or by supporting local action. Already, groups such as the Nigerian
Youth Coalition and the African youth Climate Initiative-Kenya have established school climate clubs, which are creative ways to engage young people; these
initiatives should be mainstreamed into education systems. Young people in this governance process are important because successful adaptation requires a
host of innovative measures developed with vulnerable communities to improve their present and future livelihoods. Young people are vibrant and are able to
access places that many governmental institutions fail to access. As the majority of the population and Africa's future, it is important to include them in this
impending crisis that is Climate Change.

Already, this conference calls for integrated approaches to enable African countries to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change. There is a dire need
to have a clearer understanding of the potential calamities that climate change can bring and to start the discourse on how best to stave off the worst impacts.
There is already an understanding that

Climate Change is not a localized problem but transcends national borders, hence the need for co-operation of Intergovernmental agencies but also to include
those young and vulnerable people.

Conclusion :
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS001_ALA","No longer can climate change be seen as merely an environmental problem or an energy challenge. It is a combination of both, which needs the involvement of
young people to preserve the environment and enter into green energy careers.

It's important for all of us to recognize that sustainable development isn't just a catch phrase - people all over the continent are taking it into their own hands. A
couple days ago over 300 community events took place in nearly every country on the continent of Africa, and more than 7000 globally as part of the Global
Work Party on 10/10/10.

Everywhere in the wortd, people planted trees, cultivated community gardens, installed solar panels, made buildings more efficient and implemented thousands
of other grassroots solutions to the climate crisis. We got to work everywhere in the world, but we need you, leaders, to get to work, too.

Thank you and God bless

                        African Youth at COP25

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS001_ALA","The 25th session of the Conference Parties (COP25) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held from the 2 -13
December bringing together nearly 27000 people to the Spanish capital. COP25
provided parties with the opportunity to finalize the ""rulebook"" of the Paris
Agreement - the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020.


In the spirit of the convention on climate change young people continue to enjoy




                                                                          O
various spaces during COP mainly through YOU NGO; the official youth
constituency to the UNFCCC. Article 6 ofthe Convention and Article 12 of the
Paris Agreement referred to as Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) encourage
the empowerment of every member of the society to take climate actions and
therefore young people who are most vulnerable to the climate crisis are




                                             M
increasingly becoming the centre of discussion.


The world today is home to the largest generation of young people in history and
their energy, creativity, and innovation, when harnessed properly, will accelerate




                                           E
sustainable solutions to the global crisis. Youth have a pivotal role to play in the
implementation of ACE which consists of six elements namely: education,
training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and
international cooperation.




                             D
At COP25, the Intergenerational Inquiry which is a highlight event of Young and
Future Generations Day and like every year provided a platform for youth and
decision-makers to discuss how young people can enhance the implementation
of the Paris Agreement. This platform was attended by the Executive Secretary of
the UNFCCC and provided an opportunity for young people to share the
outcome on the Conference of Youth (COY 15) to the secretariat.


The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) has continued to
empower and mobilize young people at COP through our side events and
exhibitions. Through an exhibition at COP 25, AYICC was able to showcase the
actions and contributions of African youth in the fight against climate change.
Such actions include ecological restorations, renewable energy promotion, and
local conference of youth hosted by our national chapters.


AYICC's greatest concern however, is with regards to the low representation of
African youth at the UNFCCC sessions. There are many contributing factors which
includes lack of funding, inability to assess accreditations and visas. As the first
step in addressing this, we will continue to encourage African countries to make
conscious efforts to include youth delegates in their official delegations for COPs.
We also call on development partners and stakeholders who are interested in
youth development to reach out with their support to AYICC to enhance African
youth participation in this important global process.

Climate Change


• Campaigns and Advocacy
 The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is widely known for our
 incessant campaigns and research-based advocacy on environmental and
 climate change topics. Since 2006 AYICC has been consistent with its
 campaigns impressing on African governments and international community
 alike to deliver on their commitment under the United Nations Framework
 Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) .



• Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)
 Climate change education, training, and awareness creation have been the
 central focus of AYICC targeting youth and vulnerable communities. We do
 this through workshops, conferences, and webinars leveraging on our robust
 online presence. Through our Flagship program; the African Youth Conference
 on Climate Change (AFRIYOCC) we are able to provide a platform for




                                                                     O
 exchange of ideas and sharing of knowledge and best practices among young
 African thereby feeding into article 6 of the climate change convention and
 article 12 of the Paris Agreement.



• Tree planting and Ecological restoration



                                         M
 Trees contribute to their environment by providing oxygen, improving air
 quality, climate amelioration, conserving water, preserving soil, and




                                       E
 supporting wildlife. Beyond the campaigns and advocacies, our member
 organizations embark on tree planting and reforestation activities including
 mangrove restoration along the coast.




                         D
• Renewable energy promotion
 With the increasing demand for energy for industrial and economic
 development, AYICC member organizations in different countries are
 promoting renewable energy access to isolated off-grid communities. AYICC
 believes that Youth-led renewable energy enterprises are a viable means of
 achieving sustainable development, as they promote technologies that are
 less harmful to the global environs while at the same time providing
 sustainable income-generating opportunities for youth .



• Youth in Agribusiness
 AYICC sees agriculture as an essential driver of economic development and an
 area of great opportunity for young people in Africa. The challenge, however,
 is that the growing youth population does not see agriculture as a profitable
 opportunity due to their lack of insight into the opportunities that exist within
 the agriculture value chain. Through our member organizations who are youth
 farmers themselves, AYICC has adopted various strategies including outreach
 to schools and communities, exhibitions and youth agricultural festivals as
 well as institution of award schemes for best youth farmers as a way to raise
 interest and awareness on the opportunities that exist within this sector.



• Recycling
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS001_ALA","                            Over recent years, the world has witnessed an increasing level of waste
                            products as a by-product of the increasing level of population, affluence, and
                            technological advancement in a given environment or society. In Africa we
                            have witnessed increasing level of pollution from plastic, car tires, bottles
                            among others and this has generated innovative thinking among young
                            people to provide a sustainable solution. Over the years, AYICC members have
                            redefined waste as a resource for sustainable development and through
                            various recycling initiatives, they are bringing life into materials that otherwise
                            could have been a nuisance to the environment.

The 1st African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) convened from 26th - 27th
October, 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, on the theme “African Youth Responses to Climate
Change and Food Security, Action from the Frontline.” The conference was organized by Africa
Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) in partnership with Africa Climate Policy Center
(ACPC), New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), Pan African Climate Justice
Alliance (PACJA) and Zimbabwe United Nations Association (ZUNA).
100 youths selected across Africa in the conference addressing the thematic strands of Youth in
Agribusiness; Climate Change and Development in Africa; Sustainable Agriculture and Food
Security; Green Economy and Technology Transfer; Climate Justice and Human Rights; and
Climate Change and Disaster risk reduction participated in this first edition of the African Youth
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC). This came at a time when Africa as a continent
continues to bear the biggest brunt of climate change due to low resilience and weak capacities,
with the youth despite their huge numbers and innovativeness among the vulnerable alongside
women. Despite the odds, they have been actively engaged in adaptation and mitigation




                                                                   O
initiatives that improve their communities’ resilience to climate change.
The conference therefore provided a platform for the African youths to interact and share best
practices. Five flagship projects were selected to be used as case studies by African Youths in
starting their own projects depending on transferability. The conference also saw the drafting of




                                                M
African youth position for COP 21 which was handed over to African Group of Negotiators at the
fifth Climate Change and Development in Africa Conference (CCDA V).

(AfriYOCC-2016)

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the environmental challenge of climate
change is already modifying Africa’s economies and livelihoods, health, social structure,
infrastructure and natural systems. Over the years, African youth have proved their potential in
both promoting and implementing climate change adaptation projects in their communities.
Their innovations have continually been adopted in responding to climate change impacts. This
is despite various challenges that include low capacity and education, high rates of poverty and
lack of financial resources. At the same time, African youth have been minimally represented in
the respective country policy processes as well as during the UNFCCC climate change
negotiations. Above 50% of the African population are the youth. This justifies the urgent need
for youth capacity development to respond to climate change and inclusion as key stakeholders
in policy process and negotiations. AYICC aims to spearhead new innovations, look into new
systems of success to share with policy and decision-makers, and generally aim to improve on
the current system which is causing long-term and irreversible degradation to our livelihoods –
as the leading youth organization on climate change in Africa.



                                                                    O
In cognizance of the role and potential of the African youth in climate change mitigation and
adaptation and overall sustainable development trajectory, the second African Youth




                                                 M
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC), shall be held in Nairobi, Kenya on 10th to 13th
October, 2016 as AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its formation in 2006 during the
second Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12. Building on the success of the first




                                               E
edition of conference, AfriYOCC shall provide an avenue for African youths to showcase their
climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, projects and initiatives. Best practices
arising from the various AYICC country chapters shall be developed to an African youth




                                    D
climate change adaptation and mitigation best practices database and handbook. The
meeting will dilate on the current post 2015 development agenda and the role of young
people in championing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in
Africa.

The delegates shall have an opportunity to visit ongoing Climate Change adaptation and
agribusiness projects in Kenya for hands-on skills and knowledge replicable in their countries.
Consequently, it shall boost the skills and capacities of African youths to substantially contribute
to the process leading towards and during COP 22. Through partnership with both
Governmental and Non-governmental agencies, the conference shall not only negotiate for
more youth representation in the respective country policy processes towards the forthcoming
CoPs and country specific policies, but also provide learning and engagement opportunities for
African youths. This will greatly enhance their current capacity and potential to actively
participate in both national and international platforms for policy formulation and implementation.
The conference will also provide a platform to re-assess the current position of our negotiators
and create awareness about the critical role young people should play in shifting agendas in the
forthcoming Conference of Parties in Marrakech come November 2016. While a 4 day gathering

"

issues affecting their livelihoods.

African youth have for long been side-lined to the periphery of the substantive civic and policy
issues facing the continent. However, the worst affected are the rural based youths and those
residing in farming communities, peri-urban areas and those from conflict and post conflict
countries. This has resulted in youths from these marginalized communities having no
knowledge and information on the basic climate change science and adaptation and mitigation
mechanisms. The good news though is that there is capacity amongst many young people who
are already in the circles of upcoming academia, policy specialists, lawyers, journalists and
scientists’ alike. These capacities need to be strengthened and skills shared amongst the wider
group of young people on the continent so that best practices are disseminated and resources
are expanded.

While it is an undeniable fact that climate change is affecting all regions globally, especially in
developing countries, the adverse effects in the future is likely to increase if the Paris agreement
is not ratified and effectuated by all parties. And even though a deal was achieved during
COP21 in Paris, the impacts of climate change will definitely continue into the future. This
suggests that young people will have to not just understand what climate change is and how it is




                                                                      O
affecting our world, opportunities that exists within, but most importantly, participate actively into
finding amicable solutions. Young people of Africa have therefore considered it an inherent
imperative to contribute to their future by organizing the 2nd African Youth Conference on
Climate Change in October 2016 under the theme, ‘Making Climate Finance work for




                                                  M
African Youth.’


2.1 CONFERENCE STRATEGY




                                                E
The conference program shall be based on exploring mechanisms to finance climate adaptation
and mitigation through Innovations in agriculture, technology and other sectors. It shall be




                                     D
highly interactive with unique workshop-style design that enables participants to develop their
potential through practical experience. Participants will divide to participate in thematic
workshops and come up with an African Youth position paper and concrete activities to be
included in the African Youth Strategy on Climate Change.

The delegates shall be engaged in pre-conference activities that shall include and not limited to,
mapping of youth climate change and/or mitigation projects within the conference key focus
areas for selection as best practice and include in the African youth climate change adaptation
and mitigation best practices database and handbook and aggressively fundraise towards their
participation and a successful workshop. The conference shall critically examine the various
country positions and the overall continents positions of the African Group of Negotiators, their
achievements and potentials towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It shall
examine the youth voices in these positions and further develop African youth position for
COP22.

We expect 200 youth leaders to participate in this conference. The conference is convened by
the AYICC continental secretariat in collaboration with AYICC Kenya chapter and the member

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is an umbrella youth network of African
based youth organizations, university groups, rural youth groups, schools, and individuals
working on climate change and sustainable development issues. It aims at developing capacity
and strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent need to take action
against the impacts of climate change for both present and future generations.

The initiative (always referred to as the movement) was conceived in Nairobi Kenya 10 years
ago, during the second Conference of Youth (COY2) preceding the 12th Conference of Parties
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC - COP12). The
main reason for its founding was to ensure the inclusion, and active participation of youths from
the south, and specifically Africa, in the international climate change negotiations. This was
needed as the youth are more than half the African population and are most affected by climate
change impacts. They also got massive potential to support the continent to take action on
global warming.

During its formation, it comprised of 8 country chapters and current has grown to 45 country
chapters with over 20,000 members across Africa and the Diaspora. This initiative has provided




                                                                  O
a platform for knowledge, ideas and experiences sharing. It is also an avenue for development
of skills and strategies on youth action on climate change mitigation and adaptation in the
African continent. AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a
platform for them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the




                                               M
UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others.

Since its inception, we have worked in partnership with international youth movements and have




                                             E
played a great role in the establishment of the International Youth Climate Movement whose
youth member organizations are now officially acknowledged by the UNFCCC as the YOUNGO
(Youth NGOs involved in the climate change negotiations process). Since COY2 in Nairobi, it




                                   D
has had youth delegates’ representation in all COP meetings.

In addition to the above, we have had landmark successes that include:
     A reach out programme for a children’s home (Watoto Wema in Ruai) and School
        climate change education program run in selected schools in Kenya.
     Leadership and mentorship programmes especially on volunteerism.
     Community development projects particularly on clean energy (energy saving stoves for
        rural folks)
     Capacity development of youth on agribusiness
     Advocacy campaigns e.g. lobbied for lanes to be set aside along the major highways for
        non-motorised transport especially for cyclists.
     Policy engagements i.e. contributing to the climate change bill 2012,as stakeholders
     Youth Caravan from Kenya to Durban during COP 17

African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) 2016

African Youth Conference on Climate Change will take place in Nairobi in Kenya. The conference is organized by the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change
(AYICC) and the African Climate Policy Centre from the 10 to 13 October 2016. AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its fonmation in 2006 during the second
Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12.

African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) www.ayicc.net is a continental youth network that was conceived in 2006 in Nairobi Kenya, during the
Conference of Youth held just before the UNFCCC COP12. This initiative has continued to link, and share knowledge, ideas, experiences, skills and strategies
on youth action around the continent on climate change, its mitigation and adaptation and sustainable development. In 2009, AYICC was granted observer
status to the African Minister Conference on Environment (AMCEN). AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a platform for
them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the Conference of Parties of UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others. AYICC
currently operates in over 45 African countries with over 20,000 members.

In response, to the call by AU Heads of Sates and Government to establish the CAHOSCC Youth Programme on Climate Change (CYPCC),

Founding Opportunities


AYICC Founding Opportunities

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the
environmental challenge of climate change will ultimately modify Africa's economies and livelihoods, health, social structure, infrastructure and natural
systems. To date little has been done to empower, capacitate and mobilise youth, particularly in Africa to address global environmental challenges such as
climate change. facebook d o w n ~ To remedy this, an initial step has been the formation of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC).

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change was formed partially in response to the poor representation of young Africans at the International Youth
Summit on Climate Change (November 24-28, 2005), which was held in conjunction with the United Nation's Climate Change Conference (November 28-
December 10, 2005) in Montreal , Canada. The overall mission of AYICC is to ensure that African youth are equipped toparticipate in future UNFCCC
meetings and other global initiatives for sustainable solutions to environmental degradation and climate change.

In order to ensure a strong youth presence in climate change dialogue and fora, there is a need for AYICC to ensure youth representation from various parts
of Africa. This will enable Africa's youth to engage with the global youth movement, governments and NGO's in a more coordinated and sustained manner.
The long term goal is to ensure sustainable and systematic global youth action, with special emphasis on African youth on the issue of climate change.

Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any financial assistance. The planning committee members have
volunteered their time and their contributions. However, in order to make this vision a reality we need to become a financially viable organisation. For this
reason, we would like to request your financial assistance in getting this vision off the ground.•

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE ADF 7 OPENING FORUM, 12TH OCT.10

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE OPENING FORUM OF THE SEVENTH AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FORUM, 12TH OCTOBER

2010: Ms. Esther Agbarakwe, Nigeria




The Chair,

Climate Change poses significant challenges to future generations. As youth we have a stake in this future; it is our future.




                                                                                                                 O
As the 7th African Development Forum, we have indeed come of age, we are no longer in our childhood stages of determining sustainable development - the
time of maturity has arrived. This year is marked as the International Year of Youth and now, more than ever before, the youth are taking a stand. More than
anyone else, we, the Youth, face unprecedented challenges as a result of global climate change. We also share the responsibility of addressing ii. As a group,
we are key moral stakeholders in the international processes treating the most important challenge of our generation. As it is our future, we will be
disproportionately affected by the catastrophic impacts of climate change.

Advocacy and Behavior Change: II is critical for present and future leaders to collaborate on finding solutions. The need for cultural transformation in our time




                                                                              M
is stronger than ever. This transformation - that enables us to shift towards a more sustainable world - should be an organic process, guided by principles of
compassion, integrity and justice. We need to pragmatically rethink our behavioral patterns, to enable a paradigm shift that is based on an ongoing process of
action, reflection and meaningful participation. Awareness, education and empowerment are fundamental prerequisites to enabling this process, and the youth
are energetic and passionate about holding governments and all relevant stakeholders involved accountable for their actions. We are equal partners in this
process and commit ourselves fully to achieving the objectives as decided by this Forum.




                                                                            E
Contrary to what is believed; young people play a dynamic role in framing and implementing policies. So their role goes beyond advocacy. From an advocacy
perspective, young people are involved in songs and stories which spread awareness in local languages. Of course we understand the importance and
relevance of this because 70% of Africa is based in rural areas and the term Climate Change is foreign, Young people are finding ways of using words in local
languages to translate the message across.




                                                           D
It is time to shift the balance of decision-making towards the generation that will have to manage this unwanted inheritance, to make political and economic
decisions that can span a generation, and to enable real inter-generational and inter-cultural dialogue about climate change to be realized in institutions where
the youth generation can learn.

However at the same time a range of social learning and marketing approaches need to be developed to address the gap between classroom education styles
and education that stimulates real action. This gap prevents the cultural shift from token awareness to personal action and reaction.

Education: In relation to climate change, African Governments should begin at inception to mainstream youth voices and perceptions. This is particularly
important because climate change projections indicate that effects will begin to be most felt in the next 20-30 years - young people should begin to be part of
the solution so that they will be able to cope when disaster calls. Involving them in this programme will ensure that those who will be affected will have direct
knowledge of the challenges and strategies for coping as well as the ability to mobilize communities to respond to and prepare for the impact of climate change
and natural disasters.

Governments must give credence to the higher learning education system in Africa in particular the increased accent on improvement of research and
innovation on climate change specifically highlighting on policy and reform, the programmes, pedagogy and teaching tools. This will enhance an equipped pool
of intellectual capital among the young people on climate change issues who will replicate this to the various organizations and networks that they are part of.

Al government level, during the last Conference of the Parties (COP), ii was pleasing to see that many African delegations included youth and gave them a role
to play. Furthermore, many youth who were involved in COP 15 deliberations have been interacting with their various governments and engaging in processes
and procedures that are related to Climate change policy. There is an understanding that more needs to be done, and at this forum, I urge you to engage young
people who knock on your doors asking to be involved.

Youth and youth based NGOs play a major role either in strengthening local capacity to cope or by supporting local action. Already, groups such as the Nigerian
Youth Coalition and the African youth Climate Initiative-Kenya have established school climate clubs, which are creative ways to engage young people; these
initiatives should be mainstreamed into education systems. Young people in this governance process are important because successful adaptation requires a
host of innovative measures developed with vulnerable communities to improve their present and future livelihoods. Young people are vibrant and are able to
access places that many governmental institutions fail to access. As the majority of the population and Africa's future, it is important to include them in this
impending crisis that is Climate Change.

Already, this conference calls for integrated approaches to enable African countries to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change. There is a dire need
to have a clearer understanding of the potential calamities that climate change can bring and to start the discourse on how best to stave off the worst impacts.
There is already an understanding that

Climate Change is not a localized problem but transcends national borders, hence the need for co-operation of Intergovernmental agencies but also to include
those young and vulnerable people.

Conclusion :
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS004_AfrikaTikkun","No longer can climate change be seen as merely an environmental problem or an energy challenge. It is a combination of both, which needs the involvement of
young people to preserve the environment and enter into green energy careers.

It's important for all of us to recognize that sustainable development isn't just a catch phrase - people all over the continent are taking it into their own hands. A
couple days ago over 300 community events took place in nearly every country on the continent of Africa, and more than 7000 globally as part of the Global
Work Party on 10/10/10.

Everywhere in the wortd, people planted trees, cultivated community gardens, installed solar panels, made buildings more efficient and implemented thousands
of other grassroots solutions to the climate crisis. We got to work everywhere in the world, but we need you, leaders, to get to work, too.

Thank you and God bless

                        African Youth at COP25

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS004_AfrikaTikkun","The 25th session of the Conference Parties (COP25) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held from the 2 -13
December bringing together nearly 27000 people to the Spanish capital. COP25
provided parties with the opportunity to finalize the ""rulebook"" of the Paris
Agreement - the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020.


In the spirit of the convention on climate change young people continue to enjoy




                                                                          O
various spaces during COP mainly through YOU NGO; the official youth
constituency to the UNFCCC. Article 6 ofthe Convention and Article 12 of the
Paris Agreement referred to as Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) encourage
the empowerment of every member of the society to take climate actions and
therefore young people who are most vulnerable to the climate crisis are




                                             M
increasingly becoming the centre of discussion.


The world today is home to the largest generation of young people in history and
their energy, creativity, and innovation, when harnessed properly, will accelerate




                                           E
sustainable solutions to the global crisis. Youth have a pivotal role to play in the
implementation of ACE which consists of six elements namely: education,
training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and
international cooperation.




                             D
At COP25, the Intergenerational Inquiry which is a highlight event of Young and
Future Generations Day and like every year provided a platform for youth and
decision-makers to discuss how young people can enhance the implementation
of the Paris Agreement. This platform was attended by the Executive Secretary of
the UNFCCC and provided an opportunity for young people to share the
outcome on the Conference of Youth (COY 15) to the secretariat.


The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) has continued to
empower and mobilize young people at COP through our side events and
exhibitions. Through an exhibition at COP 25, AYICC was able to showcase the
actions and contributions of African youth in the fight against climate change.
Such actions include ecological restorations, renewable energy promotion, and
local conference of youth hosted by our national chapters.


AYICC's greatest concern however, is with regards to the low representation of
African youth at the UNFCCC sessions. There are many contributing factors which
includes lack of funding, inability to assess accreditations and visas. As the first
step in addressing this, we will continue to encourage African countries to make
conscious efforts to include youth delegates in their official delegations for COPs.
We also call on development partners and stakeholders who are interested in
youth development to reach out with their support to AYICC to enhance African
youth participation in this important global process.

Climate Change


• Campaigns and Advocacy
 The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is widely known for our
 incessant campaigns and research-based advocacy on environmental and
 climate change topics. Since 2006 AYICC has been consistent with its
 campaigns impressing on African governments and international community
 alike to deliver on their commitment under the United Nations Framework
 Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) .



• Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)
 Climate change education, training, and awareness creation have been the
 central focus of AYICC targeting youth and vulnerable communities. We do
 this through workshops, conferences, and webinars leveraging on our robust
 online presence. Through our Flagship program; the African Youth Conference
 on Climate Change (AFRIYOCC) we are able to provide a platform for




                                                                     O
 exchange of ideas and sharing of knowledge and best practices among young
 African thereby feeding into article 6 of the climate change convention and
 article 12 of the Paris Agreement.



• Tree planting and Ecological restoration



                                         M
 Trees contribute to their environment by providing oxygen, improving air
 quality, climate amelioration, conserving water, preserving soil, and




                                       E
 supporting wildlife. Beyond the campaigns and advocacies, our member
 organizations embark on tree planting and reforestation activities including
 mangrove restoration along the coast.




                         D
• Renewable energy promotion
 With the increasing demand for energy for industrial and economic
 development, AYICC member organizations in different countries are
 promoting renewable energy access to isolated off-grid communities. AYICC
 believes that Youth-led renewable energy enterprises are a viable means of
 achieving sustainable development, as they promote technologies that are
 less harmful to the global environs while at the same time providing
 sustainable income-generating opportunities for youth .



• Youth in Agribusiness
 AYICC sees agriculture as an essential driver of economic development and an
 area of great opportunity for young people in Africa. The challenge, however,
 is that the growing youth population does not see agriculture as a profitable
 opportunity due to their lack of insight into the opportunities that exist within
 the agriculture value chain. Through our member organizations who are youth
 farmers themselves, AYICC has adopted various strategies including outreach
 to schools and communities, exhibitions and youth agricultural festivals as
 well as institution of award schemes for best youth farmers as a way to raise
 interest and awareness on the opportunities that exist within this sector.

                            products as a by-product of the increasing level of population, affluence, and
                            technological advancement in a given environment or society. In Africa we
                            have witnessed increasing level of pollution from plastic, car tires, bottles
                            among others and this has generated innovative thinking among young
                            people to provide a sustainable solution. Over the years, AYICC members have
                            redefined waste as a resource for sustainable development and through
                            various recycling initiatives, they are bringing life into materials that otherwise
                            could have been a nuisance to the environment.

The 1st African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) convened from 26th - 27th
October, 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, on the theme “African Youth Responses to Climate
Change and Food Security, Action from the Frontline.” The conference was organized by Africa
Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) in partnership with Africa Climate Policy Center
(ACPC), New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), Pan African Climate Justice
Alliance (PACJA) and Zimbabwe United Nations Association (ZUNA).
100 youths selected across Africa in the conference addressing the thematic strands of Youth in
Agribusiness; Climate Change and Development in Africa; Sustainable Agriculture and Food
Security; Green Economy and Technology Transfer; Climate Justice and Human Rights; and
Climate Change and Disaster risk reduction participated in this first edition of the African Youth
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC). This came at a time when Africa as a continent
continues to bear the biggest brunt of climate change due to low resilience and weak capacities,
with the youth despite their huge numbers and innovativeness among the vulnerable alongside
women. Despite the odds, they have been actively engaged in adaptation and mitigation




                                                                   O
initiatives that improve their communities’ resilience to climate change.
The conference therefore provided a platform for the African youths to interact and share best
practices. Five flagship projects were selected to be used as case studies by African Youths in
starting their own projects depending on transferability. The conference also saw the drafting of




                                                M
African youth position for COP 21 which was handed over to African Group of Negotiators at the
fifth Climate Change and Development in Africa Conference (CCDA V).

(AfriYOCC-2016)

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the environmental challenge of climate
change is already modifying Africa’s economies and livelihoods, health, social structure,
infrastructure and natural systems. Over the years, African youth have proved their potential in
both promoting and implementing climate change adaptation projects in their communities.
Their innovations have continually been adopted in responding to climate change impacts. This
is despite various challenges that include low capacity and education, high rates of poverty and
lack of financial resources. At the same time, African youth have been minimally represented in
the respective country policy processes as well as during the UNFCCC climate change
negotiations. Above 50% of the African population are the youth. This justifies the urgent need
for youth capacity development to respond to climate change and inclusion as key stakeholders
in policy process and negotiations. AYICC aims to spearhead new innovations, look into new
systems of success to share with policy and decision-makers, and generally aim to improve on
the current system which is causing long-term and irreversible degradation to our livelihoods –
as the leading youth organization on climate change in Africa.



                                                                    O
In cognizance of the role and potential of the African youth in climate change mitigation and
adaptation and overall sustainable development trajectory, the second African Youth




                                                 M
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC), shall be held in Nairobi, Kenya on 10th to 13th
October, 2016 as AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its formation in 2006 during the
second Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12. Building on the success of the first




                                               E
edition of conference, AfriYOCC shall provide an avenue for African youths to showcase their
climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, projects and initiatives. Best practices
arising from the various AYICC country chapters shall be developed to an African youth




                                    D
climate change adaptation and mitigation best practices database and handbook. The
meeting will dilate on the current post 2015 development agenda and the role of young
people in championing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in
Africa.

The delegates shall have an opportunity to visit ongoing Climate Change adaptation and
agribusiness projects in Kenya for hands-on skills and knowledge replicable in their countries.
Consequently, it shall boost the skills and capacities of African youths to substantially contribute
to the process leading towards and during COP 22. Through partnership with both
Governmental and Non-governmental agencies, the conference shall not only negotiate for
more youth representation in the respective country policy processes towards the forthcoming
CoPs and country specific policies, but also provide learning and engagement opportunities for
African youths. This will greatly enhance their current capacity and potential to actively
participate in both national and international platforms for policy formulation and implementation.
The conference will also provide a platform to re-assess the current position of our negotiators
and create awareness about the critical role young people should play in shifting agendas in the
forthcoming Conference of Parties in Marrakech come November 2016. While a 4 day gathering

issues affecting their livelihoods.

African youth have for long been side-lined to the periphery of the substantive civic and policy
issues facing the continent. However, the worst affected are the rural based youths and those
residing in farming communities, peri-urban areas and those from conflict and post conflict
countries. This has resulted in youths from these marginalized communities having no
knowledge and information on the basic climate change science and adaptation and mitigation
mechanisms. The good news though is that there is capacity amongst many young people who
are already in the circles of upcoming academia, policy specialists, lawyers, journalists and
scientists’ alike. These capacities need to be strengthened and skills shared amongst the wider
group of young people on the continent so that best practices are disseminated and resources
are expanded.

While it is an undeniable fact that climate change is affecting all regions globally, especially in
developing countries, the adverse effects in the future is likely to increase if the Paris agreement
is not ratified and effectuated by all parties. And even though a deal was achieved during
COP21 in Paris, the impacts of climate change will definitely continue into the future. This
suggests that young people will have to not just understand what climate change is and how it is




                                                                      O
affecting our world, opportunities that exists within, but most importantly, participate actively into
finding amicable solutions. Young people of Africa have therefore considered it an inherent
imperative to contribute to their future by organizing the 2nd African Youth Conference on
Climate Change in October 2016 under the theme, ‘Making Climate Finance work for




                                                  M
African Youth.’


2.1 CONFERENCE STRATEGY




                                                E
The conference program shall be based on exploring mechanisms to finance climate adaptation
and mitigation through Innovations in agriculture, technology and other sectors. It shall be




                                     D
highly interactive with unique workshop-style design that enables participants to develop their
potential through practical experience. Participants will divide to participate in thematic
workshops and come up with an African Youth position paper and concrete activities to be
included in the African Youth Strategy on Climate Change.

The delegates shall be engaged in pre-conference activities that shall include and not limited to,
mapping of youth climate change and/or mitigation projects within the conference key focus
areas for selection as best practice and include in the African youth climate change adaptation
and mitigation best practices database and handbook and aggressively fundraise towards their
participation and a successful workshop. The conference shall critically examine the various
country positions and the overall continents positions of the African Group of Negotiators, their
achievements and potentials towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It shall
examine the youth voices in these positions and further develop African youth position for
COP22.

We expect 200 youth leaders to participate in this conference. The conference is convened by
the AYICC continental secretariat in collaboration with AYICC Kenya chapter and the member

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is an umbrella youth network of African
based youth organizations, university groups, rural youth groups, schools, and individuals
working on climate change and sustainable development issues. It aims at developing capacity
and strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent need to take action
against the impacts of climate change for both present and future generations.

The initiative (always referred to as the movement) was conceived in Nairobi Kenya 10 years
ago, during the second Conference of Youth (COY2) preceding the 12th Conference of Parties
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC - COP12). The
main reason for its founding was to ensure the inclusion, and active participation of youths from
the south, and specifically Africa, in the international climate change negotiations. This was
needed as the youth are more than half the African population and are most affected by climate
change impacts. They also got massive potential to support the continent to take action on
global warming.

During its formation, it comprised of 8 country chapters and current has grown to 45 country
chapters with over 20,000 members across Africa and the Diaspora. This initiative has provided




                                                                  O
a platform for knowledge, ideas and experiences sharing. It is also an avenue for development
of skills and strategies on youth action on climate change mitigation and adaptation in the
African continent. AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a
platform for them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the




                                               M
UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others.

Since its inception, we have worked in partnership with international youth movements and have




                                             E
played a great role in the establishment of the International Youth Climate Movement whose
youth member organizations are now officially acknowledged by the UNFCCC as the YOUNGO
(Youth NGOs involved in the climate change negotiations process). Since COY2 in Nairobi, it




                                   D
has had youth delegates’ representation in all COP meetings.

In addition to the above, we have had landmark successes that include:
     A reach out programme for a children’s home (Watoto Wema in Ruai) and School
        climate change education program run in selected schools in Kenya.
     Leadership and mentorship programmes especially on volunteerism.
     Community development projects particularly on clean energy (energy saving stoves for
        rural folks)
     Capacity development of youth on agribusiness
     Advocacy campaigns e.g. lobbied for lanes to be set aside along the major highways for
        non-motorised transport especially for cyclists.
     Policy engagements i.e. contributing to the climate change bill 2012,as stakeholders
     Youth Caravan from Kenya to Durban during COP 17

African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) 2016

African Youth Conference on Climate Change will take place in Nairobi in Kenya. The conference is organized by the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change
(AYICC) and the African Climate Policy Centre from the 10 to 13 October 2016. AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its fonmation in 2006 during the second
Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12.

African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) www.ayicc.net is a continental youth network that was conceived in 2006 in Nairobi Kenya, during the
Conference of Youth held just before the UNFCCC COP12. This initiative has continued to link, and share knowledge, ideas, experiences, skills and strategies
on youth action around the continent on climate change, its mitigation and adaptation and sustainable development. In 2009, AYICC was granted observer
status to the African Minister Conference on Environment (AMCEN). AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a platform for
them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the Conference of Parties of UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others. AYICC
currently operates in over 45 African countries with over 20,000 members.

In response, to the call by AU Heads of Sates and Government to establish the CAHOSCC Youth Programme on Climate Change (CYPCC),

Founding Opportunities


AYICC Founding Opportunities

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the
environmental challenge of climate change will ultimately modify Africa's economies and livelihoods, health, social structure, infrastructure and natural
systems. To date little has been done to empower, capacitate and mobilise youth, particularly in Africa to address global environmental challenges such as
climate change. facebook d o w n ~ To remedy this, an initial step has been the formation of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC).

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change was formed partially in response to the poor representation of young Africans at the International Youth
Summit on Climate Change (November 24-28, 2005), which was held in conjunction with the United Nation's Climate Change Conference (November 28-
December 10, 2005) in Montreal , Canada. The overall mission of AYICC is to ensure that African youth are equipped toparticipate in future UNFCCC
meetings and other global initiatives for sustainable solutions to environmental degradation and climate change.

In order to ensure a strong youth presence in climate change dialogue and fora, there is a need for AYICC to ensure youth representation from various parts
of Africa. This will enable Africa's youth to engage with the global youth movement, governments and NGO's in a more coordinated and sustained manner.
The long term goal is to ensure sustainable and systematic global youth action, with special emphasis on African youth on the issue of climate change.

Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any financial assistance. The planning committee members have
volunteered their time and their contributions. However, in order to make this vision a reality we need to become a financially viable organisation. For this
reason, we would like to request your financial assistance in getting this vision off the ground.•

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE ADF 7 OPENING FORUM, 12TH OCT.10

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE OPENING FORUM OF THE SEVENTH AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FORUM, 12TH OCTOBER

2010: Ms. Esther Agbarakwe, Nigeria




The Chair,

Climate Change poses significant challenges to future generations. As youth we have a stake in this future; it is our future.




                                                                                                                 O
As the 7th African Development Forum, we have indeed come of age, we are no longer in our childhood stages of determining sustainable development - the
time of maturity has arrived. This year is marked as the International Year of Youth and now, more than ever before, the youth are taking a stand. More than
anyone else, we, the Youth, face unprecedented challenges as a result of global climate change. We also share the responsibility of addressing ii. As a group,
we are key moral stakeholders in the international processes treating the most important challenge of our generation. As it is our future, we will be
disproportionately affected by the catastrophic impacts of climate change.

Advocacy and Behavior Change: II is critical for present and future leaders to collaborate on finding solutions. The need for cultural transformation in our time




                                                                              M
is stronger than ever. This transformation - that enables us to shift towards a more sustainable world - should be an organic process, guided by principles of
compassion, integrity and justice. We need to pragmatically rethink our behavioral patterns, to enable a paradigm shift that is based on an ongoing process of
action, reflection and meaningful participation. Awareness, education and empowerment are fundamental prerequisites to enabling this process, and the youth
are energetic and passionate about holding governments and all relevant stakeholders involved accountable for their actions. We are equal partners in this
process and commit ourselves fully to achieving the objectives as decided by this Forum.




                                                                            E
Contrary to what is believed; young people play a dynamic role in framing and implementing policies. So their role goes beyond advocacy. From an advocacy
perspective, young people are involved in songs and stories which spread awareness in local languages. Of course we understand the importance and
relevance of this because 70% of Africa is based in rural areas and the term Climate Change is foreign, Young people are finding ways of using words in local
languages to translate the message across.




                                                           D
It is time to shift the balance of decision-making towards the generation that will have to manage this unwanted inheritance, to make political and economic
decisions that can span a generation, and to enable real inter-generational and inter-cultural dialogue about climate change to be realized in institutions where
the youth generation can learn.

However at the same time a range of social learning and marketing approaches need to be developed to address the gap between classroom education styles
and education that stimulates real action. This gap prevents the cultural shift from token awareness to personal action and reaction.

Education: In relation to climate change, African Governments should begin at inception to mainstream youth voices and perceptions. This is particularly
important because climate change projections indicate that effects will begin to be most felt in the next 20-30 years - young people should begin to be part of
the solution so that they will be able to cope when disaster calls. Involving them in this programme will ensure that those who will be affected will have direct
knowledge of the challenges and strategies for coping as well as the ability to mobilize communities to respond to and prepare for the impact of climate change
and natural disasters.

Governments must give credence to the higher learning education system in Africa in particular the increased accent on improvement of research and
innovation on climate change specifically highlighting on policy and reform, the programmes, pedagogy and teaching tools. This will enhance an equipped pool
of intellectual capital among the young people on climate change issues who will replicate this to the various organizations and networks that they are part of.

Al government level, during the last Conference of the Parties (COP), ii was pleasing to see that many African delegations included youth and gave them a role
to play. Furthermore, many youth who were involved in COP 15 deliberations have been interacting with their various governments and engaging in processes
and procedures that are related to Climate change policy. There is an understanding that more needs to be done, and at this forum, I urge you to engage young
people who knock on your doors asking to be involved.

Youth and youth based NGOs play a major role either in strengthening local capacity to cope or by supporting local action. Already, groups such as the Nigerian
Youth Coalition and the African youth Climate Initiative-Kenya have established school climate clubs, which are creative ways to engage young people; these
initiatives should be mainstreamed into education systems. Young people in this governance process are important because successful adaptation requires a
host of innovative measures developed with vulnerable communities to improve their present and future livelihoods. Young people are vibrant and are able to
access places that many governmental institutions fail to access. As the majority of the population and Africa's future, it is important to include them in this
impending crisis that is Climate Change.

Already, this conference calls for integrated approaches to enable African countries to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change. There is a dire need
to have a clearer understanding of the potential calamities that climate change can bring and to start the discourse on how best to stave off the worst impacts.
There is already an understanding that

Climate Change is not a localized problem but transcends national borders, hence the need for co-operation of Intergovernmental agencies but also to include
those young and vulnerable people.

Conclusion :
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS035_AndelaTechnicalLeadershipProgram","No longer can climate change be seen as merely an environmental problem or an energy challenge. It is a combination of both, which needs the involvement of
young people to preserve the environment and enter into green energy careers.

It's important for all of us to recognize that sustainable development isn't just a catch phrase - people all over the continent are taking it into their own hands. A
couple days ago over 300 community events took place in nearly every country on the continent of Africa, and more than 7000 globally as part of the Global
Work Party on 10/10/10.

Everywhere in the wortd, people planted trees, cultivated community gardens, installed solar panels, made buildings more efficient and implemented thousands
of other grassroots solutions to the climate crisis. We got to work everywhere in the world, but we need you, leaders, to get to work, too.

Thank you and God bless

                        African Youth at COP25

                        by ayicc_admin · Published May 20, 2020 · Updated May 20, 2020

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS035_AndelaTechnicalLeadershipProgram","The 25th session of the Conference Parties (COP25) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held from the 2 -13
December bringing together nearly 27000 people to the Spanish capital. COP25
provided parties with the opportunity to finalize the ""rulebook"" of the Paris
Agreement - the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020.


In the spirit of the convention on climate change young people continue to enjoy




                                                                          O
various spaces during COP mainly through YOU NGO; the official youth
constituency to the UNFCCC. Article 6 ofthe Convention and Article 12 of the
Paris Agreement referred to as Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) encourage
the empowerment of every member of the society to take climate actions and
therefore young people who are most vulnerable to the climate crisis are




                                             M
increasingly becoming the centre of discussion.


The world today is home to the largest generation of young people in history and
their energy, creativity, and innovation, when harnessed properly, will accelerate




                                           E
sustainable solutions to the global crisis. Youth have a pivotal role to play in the
implementation of ACE which consists of six elements namely: education,
training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and
international cooperation.




                             D
At COP25, the Intergenerational Inquiry which is a highlight event of Young and
Future Generations Day and like every year provided a platform for youth and
decision-makers to discuss how young people can enhance the implementation
of the Paris Agreement. This platform was attended by the Executive Secretary of
the UNFCCC and provided an opportunity for young people to share the
outcome on the Conference of Youth (COY 15) to the secretariat.


The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) has continued to
empower and mobilize young people at COP through our side events and
exhibitions. Through an exhibition at COP 25, AYICC was able to showcase the
actions and contributions of African youth in the fight against climate change.
Such actions include ecological restorations, renewable energy promotion, and
local conference of youth hosted by our national chapters.


AYICC's greatest concern however, is with regards to the low representation of
African youth at the UNFCCC sessions. There are many contributing factors which
includes lack of funding, inability to assess accreditations and visas. As the first
step in addressing this, we will continue to encourage African countries to make
conscious efforts to include youth delegates in their official delegations for COPs.
We also call on development partners and stakeholders who are interested in
youth development to reach out with their support to AYICC to enhance African
youth participation in this important global process.

Climate Change


• Campaigns and Advocacy
 The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is widely known for our
 incessant campaigns and research-based advocacy on environmental and
 climate change topics. Since 2006 AYICC has been consistent with its
 campaigns impressing on African governments and international community
 alike to deliver on their commitment under the United Nations Framework
 Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) .



• Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)
 Climate change education, training, and awareness creation have been the
 central focus of AYICC targeting youth and vulnerable communities. We do
 this through workshops, conferences, and webinars leveraging on our robust
 online presence. Through our Flagship program; the African Youth Conference
 on Climate Change (AFRIYOCC) we are able to provide a platform for




                                                                     O
 exchange of ideas and sharing of knowledge and best practices among young
 African thereby feeding into article 6 of the climate change convention and
 article 12 of the Paris Agreement.



• Tree planting and Ecological restoration



                                         M
 Trees contribute to their environment by providing oxygen, improving air
 quality, climate amelioration, conserving water, preserving soil, and




                                       E
 supporting wildlife. Beyond the campaigns and advocacies, our member
 organizations embark on tree planting and reforestation activities including
 mangrove restoration along the coast.

• Renewable energy promotion
 With the increasing demand for energy for industrial and economic
 development, AYICC member organizations in different countries are
 promoting renewable energy access to isolated off-grid communities. AYICC
 believes that Youth-led renewable energy enterprises are a viable means of
 achieving sustainable development, as they promote technologies that are
 less harmful to the global environs while at the same time providing
 sustainable income-generating opportunities for youth .



• Youth in Agribusiness
 AYICC sees agriculture as an essential driver of economic development and an
 area of great opportunity for young people in Africa. The challenge, however,
 is that the growing youth population does not see agriculture as a profitable
 opportunity due to their lack of insight into the opportunities that exist within
 the agriculture value chain. Through our member organizations who are youth
 farmers themselves, AYICC has adopted various strategies including outreach
 to schools and communities, exhibitions and youth agricultural festivals as
 well as institution of award schemes for best youth farmers as a way to raise
 interest and awareness on the opportunities that exist within this sector.

                            products as a by-product of the increasing level of population, affluence, and
                            technological advancement in a given environment or society. In Africa we
                            have witnessed increasing level of pollution from plastic, car tires, bottles
                            among others and this has generated innovative thinking among young
                            people to provide a sustainable solution. Over the years, AYICC members have
                            redefined waste as a resource for sustainable development and through
                            various recycling initiatives, they are bringing life into materials that otherwise
                            could have been a nuisance to the environment.

The 1st African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) convened from 26th - 27th
October, 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, on the theme “African Youth Responses to Climate
Change and Food Security, Action from the Frontline.” The conference was organized by Africa
Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) in partnership with Africa Climate Policy Center
(ACPC), New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), Pan African Climate Justice
Alliance (PACJA) and Zimbabwe United Nations Association (ZUNA).
100 youths selected across Africa in the conference addressing the thematic strands of Youth in
Agribusiness; Climate Change and Development in Africa; Sustainable Agriculture and Food
Security; Green Economy and Technology Transfer; Climate Justice and Human Rights; and
Climate Change and Disaster risk reduction participated in this first edition of the African Youth
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC). This came at a time when Africa as a continent
continues to bear the biggest brunt of climate change due to low resilience and weak capacities,
with the youth despite their huge numbers and innovativeness among the vulnerable alongside
women. Despite the odds, they have been actively engaged in adaptation and mitigation




                                                                   O
initiatives that improve their communities’ resilience to climate change.
The conference therefore provided a platform for the African youths to interact and share best
practices. Five flagship projects were selected to be used as case studies by African Youths in
starting their own projects depending on transferability. The conference also saw the drafting of




                                                M
African youth position for COP 21 which was handed over to African Group of Negotiators at the
fifth Climate Change and Development in Africa Conference (CCDA V).

(AfriYOCC-2016)

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the environmental challenge of climate
change is already modifying Africa’s economies and livelihoods, health, social structure,
infrastructure and natural systems. Over the years, African youth have proved their potential in
both promoting and implementing climate change adaptation projects in their communities.
Their innovations have continually been adopted in responding to climate change impacts. This
is despite various challenges that include low capacity and education, high rates of poverty and
lack of financial resources. At the same time, African youth have been minimally represented in
the respective country policy processes as well as during the UNFCCC climate change
negotiations. Above 50% of the African population are the youth. This justifies the urgent need
for youth capacity development to respond to climate change and inclusion as key stakeholders
in policy process and negotiations. AYICC aims to spearhead new innovations, look into new
systems of success to share with policy and decision-makers, and generally aim to improve on
the current system which is causing long-term and irreversible degradation to our livelihoods –
as the leading youth organization on climate change in Africa.



                                                                    O
In cognizance of the role and potential of the African youth in climate change mitigation and
adaptation and overall sustainable development trajectory, the second African Youth

Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC), shall be held in Nairobi, Kenya on 10th to 13th
October, 2016 as AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its formation in 2006 during the
second Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12. Building on the success of the first




                                               E
edition of conference, AfriYOCC shall provide an avenue for African youths to showcase their
climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, projects and initiatives. Best practices
arising from the various AYICC country chapters shall be developed to an African youth




                                    D
climate change adaptation and mitigation best practices database and handbook. The
meeting will dilate on the current post 2015 development agenda and the role of young
people in championing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in
Africa.

The delegates shall have an opportunity to visit ongoing Climate Change adaptation and
agribusiness projects in Kenya for hands-on skills and knowledge replicable in their countries.
Consequently, it shall boost the skills and capacities of African youths to substantially contribute
to the process leading towards and during COP 22. Through partnership with both
Governmental and Non-governmental agencies, the conference shall not only negotiate for
more youth representation in the respective country policy processes towards the forthcoming
CoPs and country specific policies, but also provide learning and engagement opportunities for
African youths. This will greatly enhance their current capacity and potential to actively
participate in both national and international platforms for policy formulation and implementation.
The conference will also provide a platform to re-assess the current position of our negotiators
and create awareness about the critical role young people should play in shifting agendas in the
forthcoming Conference of Parties in Marrakech come November 2016. While a 4 day gathering

issues affecting their livelihoods.

African youth have for long been side-lined to the periphery of the substantive civic and policy
issues facing the continent. However, the worst affected are the rural based youths and those
residing in farming communities, peri-urban areas and those from conflict and post conflict
countries. This has resulted in youths from these marginalized communities having no
knowledge and information on the basic climate change science and adaptation and mitigation
mechanisms. The good news though is that there is capacity amongst many young people who
are already in the circles of upcoming academia, policy specialists, lawyers, journalists and
scientists’ alike. These capacities need to be strengthened and skills shared amongst the wider
group of young people on the continent so that best practices are disseminated and resources
are expanded.

While it is an undeniable fact that climate change is affecting all regions globally, especially in
developing countries, the adverse effects in the future is likely to increase if the Paris agreement
is not ratified and effectuated by all parties. And even though a deal was achieved during
COP21 in Paris, the impacts of climate change will definitely continue into the future. This
suggests that young people will have to not just understand what climate change is and how it is




                                                                      O
affecting our world, opportunities that exists within, but most importantly, participate actively into
finding amicable solutions. Young people of Africa have therefore considered it an inherent
imperative to contribute to their future by organizing the 2nd African Youth Conference on
Climate Change in October 2016 under the theme, ‘Making Climate Finance work for




                                                  M
African Youth.’


2.1 CONFERENCE STRATEGY




                                                E
The conference program shall be based on exploring mechanisms to finance climate adaptation
and mitigation through Innovations in agriculture, technology and other sectors. It shall be




                                     D
highly interactive with unique workshop-style design that enables participants to develop their
potential through practical experience. Participants will divide to participate in thematic
workshops and come up with an African Youth position paper and concrete activities to be
included in the African Youth Strategy on Climate Change.

The delegates shall be engaged in pre-conference activities that shall include and not limited to,
mapping of youth climate change and/or mitigation projects within the conference key focus
areas for selection as best practice and include in the African youth climate change adaptation
and mitigation best practices database and handbook and aggressively fundraise towards their
participation and a successful workshop. The conference shall critically examine the various
country positions and the overall continents positions of the African Group of Negotiators, their
achievements and potentials towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It shall
examine the youth voices in these positions and further develop African youth position for
COP22.

We expect 200 youth leaders to participate in this conference. The conference is convened by
the AYICC continental secretariat in collaboration with AYICC Kenya chapter and the member

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is an umbrella youth network of African
based youth organizations, university groups, rural youth groups, schools, and individuals
working on climate change and sustainable development issues. It aims at developing capacity
and strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent need to take action
against the impacts of climate change for both present and future generations.

The initiative (always referred to as the movement) was conceived in Nairobi Kenya 10 years
ago, during the second Conference of Youth (COY2) preceding the 12th Conference of Parties
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC - COP12). The
main reason for its founding was to ensure the inclusion, and active participation of youths from
the south, and specifically Africa, in the international climate change negotiations. This was
needed as the youth are more than half the African population and are most affected by climate
change impacts. They also got massive potential to support the continent to take action on
global warming.

During its formation, it comprised of 8 country chapters and current has grown to 45 country
chapters with over 20,000 members across Africa and the Diaspora. This initiative has provided




                                                                  O
a platform for knowledge, ideas and experiences sharing. It is also an avenue for development
of skills and strategies on youth action on climate change mitigation and adaptation in the
African continent. AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a
platform for them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the




                                               M
UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others.

Since its inception, we have worked in partnership with international youth movements and have




                                             E
played a great role in the establishment of the International Youth Climate Movement whose
youth member organizations are now officially acknowledged by the UNFCCC as the YOUNGO
(Youth NGOs involved in the climate change negotiations process). Since COY2 in Nairobi, it




                                   D
has had youth delegates’ representation in all COP meetings.

In addition to the above, we have had landmark successes that include:
     A reach out programme for a children’s home (Watoto Wema in Ruai) and School
        climate change education program run in selected schools in Kenya.
     Leadership and mentorship programmes especially on volunteerism.
     Community development projects particularly on clean energy (energy saving stoves for
        rural folks)
     Capacity development of youth on agribusiness
     Advocacy campaigns e.g. lobbied for lanes to be set aside along the major highways for
        non-motorised transport especially for cyclists.
     Policy engagements i.e. contributing to the climate change bill 2012,as stakeholders
     Youth Caravan from Kenya to Durban during COP 17

African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) www.ayicc.net is a continental youth network that was conceived in 2006 in Nairobi Kenya, during the
Conference of Youth held just before the UNFCCC COP12. This initiative has continued to link, and share knowledge, ideas, experiences, skills and strategies
on youth action around the continent on climate change, its mitigation and adaptation and sustainable development. In 2009, AYICC was granted observer
status to the African Minister Conference on Environment (AMCEN). AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a platform for
them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the Conference of Parties of UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others. AYICC
currently operates in over 45 African countries with over 20,000 members.

In response, to the call by AU Heads of Sates and Government to establish the CAHOSCC Youth Programme on Climate Change (CYPCC),

Founding Opportunities


AYICC Founding Opportunities

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the
environmental challenge of climate change will ultimately modify Africa's economies and livelihoods, health, social structure, infrastructure and natural
systems. To date little has been done to empower, capacitate and mobilise youth, particularly in Africa to address global environmental challenges such as
climate change. facebook d o w n ~ To remedy this, an initial step has been the formation of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC).

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change was formed partially in response to the poor representation of young Africans at the International Youth
Summit on Climate Change (November 24-28, 2005), which was held in conjunction with the United Nation's Climate Change Conference (November 28-
December 10, 2005) in Montreal , Canada. The overall mission of AYICC is to ensure that African youth are equipped toparticipate in future UNFCCC
meetings and other global initiatives for sustainable solutions to environmental degradation and climate change.

In order to ensure a strong youth presence in climate change dialogue and fora, there is a need for AYICC to ensure youth representation from various parts
of Africa. This will enable Africa's youth to engage with the global youth movement, governments and NGO's in a more coordinated and sustained manner.
The long term goal is to ensure sustainable and systematic global youth action, with special emphasis on African youth on the issue of climate change.

Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any financial assistance. The planning committee members have
volunteered their time and their contributions. However, in order to make this vision a reality we need to become a financially viable organisation. For this
reason, we would like to request your financial assistance in getting this vision off the ground.•

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE ADF 7 OPENING FORUM, 12TH OCT.10

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE OPENING FORUM OF THE SEVENTH AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FORUM, 12TH OCTOBER

2010: Ms. Esther Agbarakwe, Nigeria




The Chair,

Climate Change poses significant challenges to future generations. As youth we have a stake in this future; it is our future.




                                                                                                                 O
As the 7th African Development Forum, we have indeed come of age, we are no longer in our childhood stages of determining sustainable development - the
time of maturity has arrived. This year is marked as the International Year of Youth and now, more than ever before, the youth are taking a stand. More than
anyone else, we, the Youth, face unprecedented challenges as a result of global climate change. We also share the responsibility of addressing ii. As a group,
we are key moral stakeholders in the international processes treating the most important challenge of our generation. As it is our future, we will be
disproportionately affected by the catastrophic impacts of climate change.

Advocacy and Behavior Change: II is critical for present and future leaders to collaborate on finding solutions. The need for cultural transformation in our time




                                                                              M
is stronger than ever. This transformation - that enables us to shift towards a more sustainable world - should be an organic process, guided by principles of
compassion, integrity and justice. We need to pragmatically rethink our behavioral patterns, to enable a paradigm shift that is based on an ongoing process of
action, reflection and meaningful participation. Awareness, education and empowerment are fundamental prerequisites to enabling this process, and the youth
are energetic and passionate about holding governments and all relevant stakeholders involved accountable for their actions. We are equal partners in this
process and commit ourselves fully to achieving the objectives as decided by this Forum.




                                                                            E
Contrary to what is believed; young people play a dynamic role in framing and implementing policies. So their role goes beyond advocacy. From an advocacy
perspective, young people are involved in songs and stories which spread awareness in local languages. Of course we understand the importance and
relevance of this because 70% of Africa is based in rural areas and the term Climate Change is foreign, Young people are finding ways of using words in local
languages to translate the message across.




                                                           D
It is time to shift the balance of decision-making towards the generation that will have to manage this unwanted inheritance, to make political and economic
decisions that can span a generation, and to enable real inter-generational and inter-cultural dialogue about climate change to be realized in institutions where
the youth generation can learn.

However at the same time a range of social learning and marketing approaches need to be developed to address the gap between classroom education styles
and education that stimulates real action. This gap prevents the cultural shift from token awareness to personal action and reaction.

Education: In relation to climate change, African Governments should begin at inception to mainstream youth voices and perceptions. This is particularly
important because climate change projections indicate that effects will begin to be most felt in the next 20-30 years - young people should begin to be part of
the solution so that they will be able to cope when disaster calls. Involving them in this programme will ensure that those who will be affected will have direct
knowledge of the challenges and strategies for coping as well as the ability to mobilize communities to respond to and prepare for the impact of climate change
and natural disasters.

Governments must give credence to the higher learning education system in Africa in particular the increased accent on improvement of research and
innovation on climate change specifically highlighting on policy and reform, the programmes, pedagogy and teaching tools. This will enhance an equipped pool
of intellectual capital among the young people on climate change issues who will replicate this to the various organizations and networks that they are part of.

Al government level, during the last Conference of the Parties (COP), ii was pleasing to see that many African delegations included youth and gave them a role
to play. Furthermore, many youth who were involved in COP 15 deliberations have been interacting with their various governments and engaging in processes
and procedures that are related to Climate change policy. There is an understanding that more needs to be done, and at this forum, I urge you to engage young
people who knock on your doors asking to be involved.

Youth and youth based NGOs play a major role either in strengthening local capacity to cope or by supporting local action. Already, groups such as the Nigerian
Youth Coalition and the African youth Climate Initiative-Kenya have established school climate clubs, which are creative ways to engage young people; these
initiatives should be mainstreamed into education systems. Young people in this governance process are important because successful adaptation requires a
host of innovative measures developed with vulnerable communities to improve their present and future livelihoods. Young people are vibrant and are able to
access places that many governmental institutions fail to access. As the majority of the population and Africa's future, it is important to include them in this
impending crisis that is Climate Change.

Already, this conference calls for integrated approaches to enable African countries to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change. There is a dire need
to have a clearer understanding of the potential calamities that climate change can bring and to start the discourse on how best to stave off the worst impacts.
There is already an understanding that

Climate Change is not a localized problem but transcends national borders, hence the need for co-operation of Intergovernmental agencies but also to include
those young and vulnerable people.

Conclusion :
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS045EmergingLeadersFoundation","No longer can climate change be seen as merely an environmental problem or an energy challenge. It is a combination of both, which needs the involvement of
young people to preserve the environment and enter into green energy careers.

It's important for all of us to recognize that sustainable development isn't just a catch phrase - people all over the continent are taking it into their own hands. A
couple days ago over 300 community events took place in nearly every country on the continent of Africa, and more than 7000 globally as part of the Global
Work Party on 10/10/10.

Everywhere in the wortd, people planted trees, cultivated community gardens, installed solar panels, made buildings more efficient and implemented thousands
of other grassroots solutions to the climate crisis. We got to work everywhere in the world, but we need you, leaders, to get to work, too.

Thank you and God bless

                        African Youth at COP25

                        by ayicc_admin · Published May 20, 2020 · Updated May 20, 2020
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS045EmergingLeadersFoundation","The 25th session of the Conference Parties (COP25) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held from the 2 -13
December bringing together nearly 27000 people to the Spanish capital. COP25
provided parties with the opportunity to finalize the ""rulebook"" of the Paris
Agreement - the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020.


In the spirit of the convention on climate change young people continue to enjoy




                                                                          O
various spaces during COP mainly through YOU NGO; the official youth
constituency to the UNFCCC. Article 6 ofthe Convention and Article 12 of the
Paris Agreement referred to as Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) encourage
the empowerment of every member of the society to take climate actions and
therefore young people who are most vulnerable to the climate crisis are




                                             M
increasingly becoming the centre of discussion.


The world today is home to the largest generation of young people in history and
their energy, creativity, and innovation, when harnessed properly, will accelerate




                                           E
sustainable solutions to the global crisis. Youth have a pivotal role to play in the
implementation of ACE which consists of six elements namely: education,
training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and
international cooperation.




                             D
At COP25, the Intergenerational Inquiry which is a highlight event of Young and
Future Generations Day and like every year provided a platform for youth and
decision-makers to discuss how young people can enhance the implementation
of the Paris Agreement. This platform was attended by the Executive Secretary of
the UNFCCC and provided an opportunity for young people to share the
outcome on the Conference of Youth (COY 15) to the secretariat.


The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) has continued to
empower and mobilize young people at COP through our side events and
exhibitions. Through an exhibition at COP 25, AYICC was able to showcase the
actions and contributions of African youth in the fight against climate change.
Such actions include ecological restorations, renewable energy promotion, and
local conference of youth hosted by our national chapters.


AYICC's greatest concern however, is with regards to the low representation of
African youth at the UNFCCC sessions. There are many contributing factors which
includes lack of funding, inability to assess accreditations and visas. As the first
step in addressing this, we will continue to encourage African countries to make
conscious efforts to include youth delegates in their official delegations for COPs.
We also call on development partners and stakeholders who are interested in
youth development to reach out with their support to AYICC to enhance African
youth participation in this important global process.

Climate Change


• Campaigns and Advocacy
 The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is widely known for our
 incessant campaigns and research-based advocacy on environmental and
 climate change topics. Since 2006 AYICC has been consistent with its
 campaigns impressing on African governments and international community
 alike to deliver on their commitment under the United Nations Framework
 Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) .



• Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)
 Climate change education, training, and awareness creation have been the
 central focus of AYICC targeting youth and vulnerable communities. We do
 this through workshops, conferences, and webinars leveraging on our robust
 online presence. Through our Flagship program; the African Youth Conference
 on Climate Change (AFRIYOCC) we are able to provide a platform for




                                                                     O
 exchange of ideas and sharing of knowledge and best practices among young
 African thereby feeding into article 6 of the climate change convention and
 article 12 of the Paris Agreement.



• Tree planting and Ecological restoration



                                         M
 Trees contribute to their environment by providing oxygen, improving air
 quality, climate amelioration, conserving water, preserving soil, and




                                       E
 supporting wildlife. Beyond the campaigns and advocacies, our member
 organizations embark on tree planting and reforestation activities including
 mangrove restoration along the coast.




                         D
• Renewable energy promotion
 With the increasing demand for energy for industrial and economic
 development, AYICC member organizations in different countries are
 promoting renewable energy access to isolated off-grid communities. AYICC
 believes that Youth-led renewable energy enterprises are a viable means of
 achieving sustainable development, as they promote technologies that are
 less harmful to the global environs while at the same time providing
 sustainable income-generating opportunities for youth .



• Youth in Agribusiness
 AYICC sees agriculture as an essential driver of economic development and an
 area of great opportunity for young people in Africa. The challenge, however,
 is that the growing youth population does not see agriculture as a profitable
 opportunity due to their lack of insight into the opportunities that exist within
 the agriculture value chain. Through our member organizations who are youth
 farmers themselves, AYICC has adopted various strategies including outreach
 to schools and communities, exhibitions and youth agricultural festivals as
 well as institution of award schemes for best youth farmers as a way to raise
 interest and awareness on the opportunities that exist within this sector.



• Recycling

                            products as a by-product of the increasing level of population, affluence, and
                            technological advancement in a given environment or society. In Africa we
                            have witnessed increasing level of pollution from plastic, car tires, bottles
                            among others and this has generated innovative thinking among young
                            people to provide a sustainable solution. Over the years, AYICC members have
                            redefined waste as a resource for sustainable development and through
                            various recycling initiatives, they are bringing life into materials that otherwise
                            could have been a nuisance to the environment.

The 1st African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) convened from 26th - 27th
October, 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, on the theme “African Youth Responses to Climate
Change and Food Security, Action from the Frontline.” The conference was organized by Africa
Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) in partnership with Africa Climate Policy Center
(ACPC), New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), Pan African Climate Justice
Alliance (PACJA) and Zimbabwe United Nations Association (ZUNA).
100 youths selected across Africa in the conference addressing the thematic strands of Youth in
Agribusiness; Climate Change and Development in Africa; Sustainable Agriculture and Food
Security; Green Economy and Technology Transfer; Climate Justice and Human Rights; and
Climate Change and Disaster risk reduction participated in this first edition of the African Youth
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC). This came at a time when Africa as a continent
continues to bear the biggest brunt of climate change due to low resilience and weak capacities,
with the youth despite their huge numbers and innovativeness among the vulnerable alongside
women. Despite the odds, they have been actively engaged in adaptation and mitigation




                                                                   O
initiatives that improve their communities’ resilience to climate change.
The conference therefore provided a platform for the African youths to interact and share best
practices. Five flagship projects were selected to be used as case studies by African Youths in
starting their own projects depending on transferability. The conference also saw the drafting of




                                                M
African youth position for COP 21 which was handed over to African Group of Negotiators at the
fifth Climate Change and Development in Africa Conference (CCDA V).

(AfriYOCC-2016)

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the environmental challenge of climate
change is already modifying Africa’s economies and livelihoods, health, social structure,
infrastructure and natural systems. Over the years, African youth have proved their potential in
both promoting and implementing climate change adaptation projects in their communities.
Their innovations have continually been adopted in responding to climate change impacts. This
is despite various challenges that include low capacity and education, high rates of poverty and
lack of financial resources. At the same time, African youth have been minimally represented in
the respective country policy processes as well as during the UNFCCC climate change
negotiations. Above 50% of the African population are the youth. This justifies the urgent need
for youth capacity development to respond to climate change and inclusion as key stakeholders
in policy process and negotiations. AYICC aims to spearhead new innovations, look into new
systems of success to share with policy and decision-makers, and generally aim to improve on
the current system which is causing long-term and irreversible degradation to our livelihoods –
as the leading youth organization on climate change in Africa.



                                                                    O
In cognizance of the role and potential of the African youth in climate change mitigation and
adaptation and overall sustainable development trajectory, the second African Youth

Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC), shall be held in Nairobi, Kenya on 10th to 13th
October, 2016 as AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its formation in 2006 during the
second Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12. Building on the success of the first




                                               E
edition of conference, AfriYOCC shall provide an avenue for African youths to showcase their
climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, projects and initiatives. Best practices
arising from the various AYICC country chapters shall be developed to an African youth




                                    D
climate change adaptation and mitigation best practices database and handbook. The
meeting will dilate on the current post 2015 development agenda and the role of young
people in championing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in
Africa.

The delegates shall have an opportunity to visit ongoing Climate Change adaptation and
agribusiness projects in Kenya for hands-on skills and knowledge replicable in their countries.
Consequently, it shall boost the skills and capacities of African youths to substantially contribute
to the process leading towards and during COP 22. Through partnership with both
Governmental and Non-governmental agencies, the conference shall not only negotiate for
more youth representation in the respective country policy processes towards the forthcoming
CoPs and country specific policies, but also provide learning and engagement opportunities for
African youths. This will greatly enhance their current capacity and potential to actively
participate in both national and international platforms for policy formulation and implementation.
The conference will also provide a platform to re-assess the current position of our negotiators
and create awareness about the critical role young people should play in shifting agendas in the
forthcoming Conference of Parties in Marrakech come November 2016. While a 4 day gathering

issues affecting their livelihoods.

African youth have for long been side-lined to the periphery of the substantive civic and policy
issues facing the continent. However, the worst affected are the rural based youths and those
residing in farming communities, peri-urban areas and those from conflict and post conflict
countries. This has resulted in youths from these marginalized communities having no
knowledge and information on the basic climate change science and adaptation and mitigation
mechanisms. The good news though is that there is capacity amongst many young people who
are already in the circles of upcoming academia, policy specialists, lawyers, journalists and
scientists’ alike. These capacities need to be strengthened and skills shared amongst the wider
group of young people on the continent so that best practices are disseminated and resources
are expanded.

While it is an undeniable fact that climate change is affecting all regions globally, especially in
developing countries, the adverse effects in the future is likely to increase if the Paris agreement
is not ratified and effectuated by all parties. And even though a deal was achieved during
COP21 in Paris, the impacts of climate change will definitely continue into the future. This
suggests that young people will have to not just understand what climate change is and how it is




                                                                      O
affecting our world, opportunities that exists within, but most importantly, participate actively into
finding amicable solutions. Young people of Africa have therefore considered it an inherent
imperative to contribute to their future by organizing the 2nd African Youth Conference on
Climate Change in October 2016 under the theme, ‘Making Climate Finance work for




                                                  M
African Youth.’


2.1 CONFERENCE STRATEGY




                                                E
The conference program shall be based on exploring mechanisms to finance climate adaptation
and mitigation through Innovations in agriculture, technology and other sectors. It shall be




                                     D
highly interactive with unique workshop-style design that enables participants to develop their
potential through practical experience. Participants will divide to participate in thematic
workshops and come up with an African Youth position paper and concrete activities to be
included in the African Youth Strategy on Climate Change.

The delegates shall be engaged in pre-conference activities that shall include and not limited to,
mapping of youth climate change and/or mitigation projects within the conference key focus
areas for selection as best practice and include in the African youth climate change adaptation
and mitigation best practices database and handbook and aggressively fundraise towards their
participation and a successful workshop. The conference shall critically examine the various
country positions and the overall continents positions of the African Group of Negotiators, their
achievements and potentials towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It shall
examine the youth voices in these positions and further develop African youth position for
COP22.

We expect 200 youth leaders to participate in this conference. The conference is convened by
the AYICC continental secretariat in collaboration with AYICC Kenya chapter and the member

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is an umbrella youth network of African
based youth organizations, university groups, rural youth groups, schools, and individuals
working on climate change and sustainable development issues. It aims at developing capacity
and strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent need to take action
against the impacts of climate change for both present and future generations.

The initiative (always referred to as the movement) was conceived in Nairobi Kenya 10 years
ago, during the second Conference of Youth (COY2) preceding the 12th Conference of Parties
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC - COP12). The
main reason for its founding was to ensure the inclusion, and active participation of youths from
the south, and specifically Africa, in the international climate change negotiations. This was
needed as the youth are more than half the African population and are most affected by climate
change impacts. They also got massive potential to support the continent to take action on
global warming.

During its formation, it comprised of 8 country chapters and current has grown to 45 country
chapters with over 20,000 members across Africa and the Diaspora. This initiative has provided




                                                                  O
a platform for knowledge, ideas and experiences sharing. It is also an avenue for development
of skills and strategies on youth action on climate change mitigation and adaptation in the
African continent. AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a
platform for them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the




                                               M
UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others.

Since its inception, we have worked in partnership with international youth movements and have




                                             E
played a great role in the establishment of the International Youth Climate Movement whose
youth member organizations are now officially acknowledged by the UNFCCC as the YOUNGO
(Youth NGOs involved in the climate change negotiations process). Since COY2 in Nairobi, it




                                   D
has had youth delegates’ representation in all COP meetings.

In addition to the above, we have had landmark successes that include:
     A reach out programme for a children’s home (Watoto Wema in Ruai) and School
        climate change education program run in selected schools in Kenya.
     Leadership and mentorship programmes especially on volunteerism.
     Community development projects particularly on clean energy (energy saving stoves for
        rural folks)
     Capacity development of youth on agribusiness
     Advocacy campaigns e.g. lobbied for lanes to be set aside along the major highways for
        non-motorised transport especially for cyclists.
     Policy engagements i.e. contributing to the climate change bill 2012,as stakeholders
     Youth Caravan from Kenya to Durban during COP 17

Conference of Youth held just before the UNFCCC COP12. This initiative has continued to link, and share knowledge, ideas, experiences, skills and strategies
on youth action around the continent on climate change, its mitigation and adaptation and sustainable development. In 2009, AYICC was granted observer
status to the African Minister Conference on Environment (AMCEN). AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a platform for
them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the Conference of Parties of UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others. AYICC
currently operates in over 45 African countries with over 20,000 members.

Founding Opportunities


AYICC Founding Opportunities

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the
environmental challenge of climate change will ultimately modify Africa's economies and livelihoods, health, social structure, infrastructure and natural
systems. To date little has been done to empower, capacitate and mobilise youth, particularly in Africa to address global environmental challenges such as
climate change. facebook d o w n ~ To remedy this, an initial step has been the formation of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC).

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change was formed partially in response to the poor representation of young Africans at the International Youth
Summit on Climate Change (November 24-28, 2005), which was held in conjunction with the United Nation's Climate Change Conference (November 28-
December 10, 2005) in Montreal , Canada. The overall mission of AYICC is to ensure that African youth are equipped toparticipate in future UNFCCC
meetings and other global initiatives for sustainable solutions to environmental degradation and climate change.

In order to ensure a strong youth presence in climate change dialogue and fora, there is a need for AYICC to ensure youth representation from various parts
of Africa. This will enable Africa's youth to engage with the global youth movement, governments and NGO's in a more coordinated and sustained manner.
The long term goal is to ensure sustainable and systematic global youth action, with special emphasis on African youth on the issue of climate change.

Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any financial assistance. The planning committee members have
volunteered their time and their contributions. However, in order to make this vision a reality we need to become a financially viable organisation. For this
reason, we would like to request your financial assistance in getting this vision off the ground.•

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE OPENING FORUM OF THE SEVENTH AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FORUM, 12TH OCTOBER

2010: Ms. Esther Agbarakwe, Nigeria




The Chair,

Climate Change poses significant challenges to future generations. As youth we have a stake in this future; it is our future.




                                                                                                                 O
As the 7th African Development Forum, we have indeed come of age, we are no longer in our childhood stages of determining sustainable development - the
time of maturity has arrived. This year is marked as the International Year of Youth and now, more than ever before, the youth are taking a stand. More than
anyone else, we, the Youth, face unprecedented challenges as a result of global climate change. We also share the responsibility of addressing ii. As a group,
we are key moral stakeholders in the international processes treating the most important challenge of our generation. As it is our future, we will be
disproportionately affected by the catastrophic impacts of climate change.

Advocacy and Behavior Change: II is critical for present and future leaders to collaborate on finding solutions. The need for cultural transformation in our time




                                                                              M
is stronger than ever. This transformation - that enables us to shift towards a more sustainable world - should be an organic process, guided by principles of
compassion, integrity and justice. We need to pragmatically rethink our behavioral patterns, to enable a paradigm shift that is based on an ongoing process of
action, reflection and meaningful participation. Awareness, education and empowerment are fundamental prerequisites to enabling this process, and the youth
are energetic and passionate about holding governments and all relevant stakeholders involved accountable for their actions. We are equal partners in this
process and commit ourselves fully to achieving the objectives as decided by this Forum.




                                                                            E
Contrary to what is believed; young people play a dynamic role in framing and implementing policies. So their role goes beyond advocacy. From an advocacy
perspective, young people are involved in songs and stories which spread awareness in local languages. Of course we understand the importance and
relevance of this because 70% of Africa is based in rural areas and the term Climate Change is foreign, Young people are finding ways of using words in local
languages to translate the message across.




                                                           D
It is time to shift the balance of decision-making towards the generation that will have to manage this unwanted inheritance, to make political and economic
decisions that can span a generation, and to enable real inter-generational and inter-cultural dialogue about climate change to be realized in institutions where
the youth generation can learn.

However at the same time a range of social learning and marketing approaches need to be developed to address the gap between classroom education styles
and education that stimulates real action. This gap prevents the cultural shift from token awareness to personal action and reaction.

Education: In relation to climate change, African Governments should begin at inception to mainstream youth voices and perceptions. This is particularly
important because climate change projections indicate that effects will begin to be most felt in the next 20-30 years - young people should begin to be part of
the solution so that they will be able to cope when disaster calls. Involving them in this programme will ensure that those who will be affected will have direct
knowledge of the challenges and strategies for coping as well as the ability to mobilize communities to respond to and prepare for the impact of climate change
and natural disasters.

Governments must give credence to the higher learning education system in Africa in particular the increased accent on improvement of research and
innovation on climate change specifically highlighting on policy and reform, the programmes, pedagogy and teaching tools. This will enhance an equipped pool
of intellectual capital among the young people on climate change issues who will replicate this to the various organizations and networks that they are part of.

Al government level, during the last Conference of the Parties (COP), ii was pleasing to see that many African delegations included youth and gave them a role
to play. Furthermore, many youth who were involved in COP 15 deliberations have been interacting with their various governments and engaging in processes
and procedures that are related to Climate change policy. There is an understanding that more needs to be done, and at this forum, I urge you to engage young
people who knock on your doors asking to be involved.

Youth and youth based NGOs play a major role either in strengthening local capacity to cope or by supporting local action. Already, groups such as the Nigerian
Youth Coalition and the African youth Climate Initiative-Kenya have established school climate clubs, which are creative ways to engage young people; these
initiatives should be mainstreamed into education systems. Young people in this governance process are important because successful adaptation requires a
host of innovative measures developed with vulnerable communities to improve their present and future livelihoods. Young people are vibrant and are able to
access places that many governmental institutions fail to access. As the majority of the population and Africa's future, it is important to include them in this
impending crisis that is Climate Change.

Already, this conference calls for integrated approaches to enable African countries to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change. There is a dire need
to have a clearer understanding of the potential calamities that climate change can bring and to start the discourse on how best to stave off the worst impacts.
There is already an understanding that

Climate Change is not a localized problem but transcends national borders, hence the need for co-operation of Intergovernmental agencies but also to include
those young and vulnerable people.

Conclusion :
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS059_1BillionAfrica","No longer can climate change be seen as merely an environmental problem or an energy challenge. It is a combination of both, which needs the involvement of
young people to preserve the environment and enter into green energy careers.

It's important for all of us to recognize that sustainable development isn't just a catch phrase - people all over the continent are taking it into their own hands. A
couple days ago over 300 community events took place in nearly every country on the continent of Africa, and more than 7000 globally as part of the Global
Work Party on 10/10/10.

Everywhere in the wortd, people planted trees, cultivated community gardens, installed solar panels, made buildings more efficient and implemented thousands
of other grassroots solutions to the climate crisis. We got to work everywhere in the world, but we need you, leaders, to get to work, too.

Thank you and God bless

                        African Youth at COP25

"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS059_1BillionAfrica","The 25th session of the Conference Parties (COP25) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held from the 2 -13
December bringing together nearly 27000 people to the Spanish capital. COP25
provided parties with the opportunity to finalize the ""rulebook"" of the Paris
Agreement - the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020.


In the spirit of the convention on climate change young people continue to enjoy




                                                                          O
various spaces during COP mainly through YOU NGO; the official youth
constituency to the UNFCCC. Article 6 ofthe Convention and Article 12 of the
Paris Agreement referred to as Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) encourage
the empowerment of every member of the society to take climate actions and
therefore young people who are most vulnerable to the climate crisis are




                                             M
increasingly becoming the centre of discussion.


The world today is home to the largest generation of young people in history and
their energy, creativity, and innovation, when harnessed properly, will accelerate




                                           E
sustainable solutions to the global crisis. Youth have a pivotal role to play in the
implementation of ACE which consists of six elements namely: education,
training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and
international cooperation.




                             D
At COP25, the Intergenerational Inquiry which is a highlight event of Young and
Future Generations Day and like every year provided a platform for youth and
decision-makers to discuss how young people can enhance the implementation
of the Paris Agreement. This platform was attended by the Executive Secretary of
the UNFCCC and provided an opportunity for young people to share the
outcome on the Conference of Youth (COY 15) to the secretariat.


The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) has continued to
empower and mobilize young people at COP through our side events and
exhibitions. Through an exhibition at COP 25, AYICC was able to showcase the
actions and contributions of African youth in the fight against climate change.
Such actions include ecological restorations, renewable energy promotion, and
local conference of youth hosted by our national chapters.


AYICC's greatest concern however, is with regards to the low representation of
African youth at the UNFCCC sessions. There are many contributing factors which
includes lack of funding, inability to assess accreditations and visas. As the first
step in addressing this, we will continue to encourage African countries to make
conscious efforts to include youth delegates in their official delegations for COPs.
We also call on development partners and stakeholders who are interested in
youth development to reach out with their support to AYICC to enhance African
youth participation in this important global process.

Climate Change


• Campaigns and Advocacy
 The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is widely known for our
 incessant campaigns and research-based advocacy on environmental and
 climate change topics. Since 2006 AYICC has been consistent with its
 campaigns impressing on African governments and international community
 alike to deliver on their commitment under the United Nations Framework
 Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) .



• Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)
 Climate change education, training, and awareness creation have been the
 central focus of AYICC targeting youth and vulnerable communities. We do
 this through workshops, conferences, and webinars leveraging on our robust
 online presence. Through our Flagship program; the African Youth Conference
 on Climate Change (AFRIYOCC) we are able to provide a platform for




                                                                     O
 exchange of ideas and sharing of knowledge and best practices among young
 African thereby feeding into article 6 of the climate change convention and
 article 12 of the Paris Agreement.



• Tree planting and Ecological restoration



                                         M
 Trees contribute to their environment by providing oxygen, improving air
 quality, climate amelioration, conserving water, preserving soil, and




                                       E
 supporting wildlife. Beyond the campaigns and advocacies, our member
 organizations embark on tree planting and reforestation activities including
 mangrove restoration along the coast.




                         D
• Renewable energy promotion
 With the increasing demand for energy for industrial and economic
 development, AYICC member organizations in different countries are
 promoting renewable energy access to isolated off-grid communities. AYICC
 believes that Youth-led renewable energy enterprises are a viable means of
 achieving sustainable development, as they promote technologies that are
 less harmful to the global environs while at the same time providing
 sustainable income-generating opportunities for youth .



• Youth in Agribusiness
 AYICC sees agriculture as an essential driver of economic development and an
 area of great opportunity for young people in Africa. The challenge, however,
 is that the growing youth population does not see agriculture as a profitable
 opportunity due to their lack of insight into the opportunities that exist within
 the agriculture value chain. Through our member organizations who are youth
 farmers themselves, AYICC has adopted various strategies including outreach
 to schools and communities, exhibitions and youth agricultural festivals as
 well as institution of award schemes for best youth farmers as a way to raise
 interest and awareness on the opportunities that exist within this sector.



• Recycling

                            products as a by-product of the increasing level of population, affluence, and
                            technological advancement in a given environment or society. In Africa we
                            have witnessed increasing level of pollution from plastic, car tires, bottles
                            among others and this has generated innovative thinking among young
                            people to provide a sustainable solution. Over the years, AYICC members have
                            redefined waste as a resource for sustainable development and through
                            various recycling initiatives, they are bringing life into materials that otherwise
                            could have been a nuisance to the environment.

The 1st African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) convened from 26th - 27th
October, 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, on the theme “African Youth Responses to Climate
Change and Food Security, Action from the Frontline.” The conference was organized by Africa
Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) in partnership with Africa Climate Policy Center
(ACPC), New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), Pan African Climate Justice
Alliance (PACJA) and Zimbabwe United Nations Association (ZUNA).
100 youths selected across Africa in the conference addressing the thematic strands of Youth in
Agribusiness; Climate Change and Development in Africa; Sustainable Agriculture and Food
Security; Green Economy and Technology Transfer; Climate Justice and Human Rights; and
Climate Change and Disaster risk reduction participated in this first edition of the African Youth
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC). This came at a time when Africa as a continent
continues to bear the biggest brunt of climate change due to low resilience and weak capacities,
with the youth despite their huge numbers and innovativeness among the vulnerable alongside
women. Despite the odds, they have been actively engaged in adaptation and mitigation




                                                                   O
initiatives that improve their communities’ resilience to climate change.
The conference therefore provided a platform for the African youths to interact and share best
practices. Five flagship projects were selected to be used as case studies by African Youths in
starting their own projects depending on transferability. The conference also saw the drafting of

African youth position for COP 21 which was handed over to African Group of Negotiators at the
fifth Climate Change and Development in Africa Conference (CCDA V).

(AfriYOCC-2016)

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the environmental challenge of climate
change is already modifying Africa’s economies and livelihoods, health, social structure,
infrastructure and natural systems. Over the years, African youth have proved their potential in
both promoting and implementing climate change adaptation projects in their communities.
Their innovations have continually been adopted in responding to climate change impacts. This
is despite various challenges that include low capacity and education, high rates of poverty and
lack of financial resources. At the same time, African youth have been minimally represented in
the respective country policy processes as well as during the UNFCCC climate change
negotiations. Above 50% of the African population are the youth. This justifies the urgent need
for youth capacity development to respond to climate change and inclusion as key stakeholders
in policy process and negotiations. AYICC aims to spearhead new innovations, look into new
systems of success to share with policy and decision-makers, and generally aim to improve on
the current system which is causing long-term and irreversible degradation to our livelihoods –
as the leading youth organization on climate change in Africa.



                                                                    O
In cognizance of the role and potential of the African youth in climate change mitigation and
adaptation and overall sustainable development trajectory, the second African Youth

Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC), shall be held in Nairobi, Kenya on 10th to 13th
October, 2016 as AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its formation in 2006 during the
second Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12. Building on the success of the first




                                               E
edition of conference, AfriYOCC shall provide an avenue for African youths to showcase their
climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, projects and initiatives. Best practices
arising from the various AYICC country chapters shall be developed to an African youth




                                    D
climate change adaptation and mitigation best practices database and handbook. The
meeting will dilate on the current post 2015 development agenda and the role of young
people in championing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in
Africa.

The delegates shall have an opportunity to visit ongoing Climate Change adaptation and
agribusiness projects in Kenya for hands-on skills and knowledge replicable in their countries.
Consequently, it shall boost the skills and capacities of African youths to substantially contribute
to the process leading towards and during COP 22. Through partnership with both
Governmental and Non-governmental agencies, the conference shall not only negotiate for
more youth representation in the respective country policy processes towards the forthcoming
CoPs and country specific policies, but also provide learning and engagement opportunities for
African youths. This will greatly enhance their current capacity and potential to actively
participate in both national and international platforms for policy formulation and implementation.
The conference will also provide a platform to re-assess the current position of our negotiators
and create awareness about the critical role young people should play in shifting agendas in the
forthcoming Conference of Parties in Marrakech come November 2016. While a 4 day gathering

issues affecting their livelihoods.

African youth have for long been side-lined to the periphery of the substantive civic and policy
issues facing the continent. However, the worst affected are the rural based youths and those
residing in farming communities, peri-urban areas and those from conflict and post conflict
countries. This has resulted in youths from these marginalized communities having no
knowledge and information on the basic climate change science and adaptation and mitigation
mechanisms. The good news though is that there is capacity amongst many young people who
are already in the circles of upcoming academia, policy specialists, lawyers, journalists and
scientists’ alike. These capacities need to be strengthened and skills shared amongst the wider
group of young people on the continent so that best practices are disseminated and resources
are expanded.

While it is an undeniable fact that climate change is affecting all regions globally, especially in
developing countries, the adverse effects in the future is likely to increase if the Paris agreement
is not ratified and effectuated by all parties. And even though a deal was achieved during
COP21 in Paris, the impacts of climate change will definitely continue into the future. This
suggests that young people will have to not just understand what climate change is and how it is




                                                                      O
affecting our world, opportunities that exists within, but most importantly, participate actively into
finding amicable solutions. Young people of Africa have therefore considered it an inherent
imperative to contribute to their future by organizing the 2nd African Youth Conference on
Climate Change in October 2016 under the theme, ‘Making Climate Finance work for




                                                  M
African Youth.’


2.1 CONFERENCE STRATEGY




                                                E
The conference program shall be based on exploring mechanisms to finance climate adaptation
and mitigation through Innovations in agriculture, technology and other sectors. It shall be




                                     D
highly interactive with unique workshop-style design that enables participants to develop their
potential through practical experience. Participants will divide to participate in thematic
workshops and come up with an African Youth position paper and concrete activities to be
included in the African Youth Strategy on Climate Change.

The delegates shall be engaged in pre-conference activities that shall include and not limited to,
mapping of youth climate change and/or mitigation projects within the conference key focus
areas for selection as best practice and include in the African youth climate change adaptation
and mitigation best practices database and handbook and aggressively fundraise towards their
participation and a successful workshop. The conference shall critically examine the various
country positions and the overall continents positions of the African Group of Negotiators, their
achievements and potentials towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It shall
examine the youth voices in these positions and further develop African youth position for
COP22.

We expect 200 youth leaders to participate in this conference. The conference is convened by
the AYICC continental secretariat in collaboration with AYICC Kenya chapter and the member

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is an umbrella youth network of African
based youth organizations, university groups, rural youth groups, schools, and individuals
working on climate change and sustainable development issues. It aims at developing capacity
and strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent need to take action
against the impacts of climate change for both present and future generations.

The initiative (always referred to as the movement) was conceived in Nairobi Kenya 10 years
ago, during the second Conference of Youth (COY2) preceding the 12th Conference of Parties
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC - COP12). The
main reason for its founding was to ensure the inclusion, and active participation of youths from
the south, and specifically Africa, in the international climate change negotiations. This was
needed as the youth are more than half the African population and are most affected by climate
change impacts. They also got massive potential to support the continent to take action on
global warming.

During its formation, it comprised of 8 country chapters and current has grown to 45 country
chapters with over 20,000 members across Africa and the Diaspora. This initiative has provided




                                                                  O
a platform for knowledge, ideas and experiences sharing. It is also an avenue for development
of skills and strategies on youth action on climate change mitigation and adaptation in the
African continent. AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a
platform for them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the




                                               M
UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others.

Since its inception, we have worked in partnership with international youth movements and have




                                             E
played a great role in the establishment of the International Youth Climate Movement whose
youth member organizations are now officially acknowledged by the UNFCCC as the YOUNGO
(Youth NGOs involved in the climate change negotiations process). Since COY2 in Nairobi, it




                                   D
has had youth delegates’ representation in all COP meetings.

In addition to the above, we have had landmark successes that include:
     A reach out programme for a children’s home (Watoto Wema in Ruai) and School
        climate change education program run in selected schools in Kenya.
     Leadership and mentorship programmes especially on volunteerism.
     Community development projects particularly on clean energy (energy saving stoves for
        rural folks)
     Capacity development of youth on agribusiness
     Advocacy campaigns e.g. lobbied for lanes to be set aside along the major highways for
        non-motorised transport especially for cyclists.
     Policy engagements i.e. contributing to the climate change bill 2012,as stakeholders
     Youth Caravan from Kenya to Durban during COP 17

Conference of Youth held just before the UNFCCC COP12. This initiative has continued to link, and share knowledge, ideas, experiences, skills and strategies
on youth action around the continent on climate change, its mitigation and adaptation and sustainable development. In 2009, AYICC was granted observer
status to the African Minister Conference on Environment (AMCEN). AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a platform for
them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the Conference of Parties of UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others. AYICC
currently operates in over 45 African countries with over 20,000 members.

In response, to the call by AU Heads of Sates and Government to establish the CAHOSCC Youth Programme on Climate Change (CYPCC),

Founding Opportunities


AYICC Founding Opportunities

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the
environmental challenge of climate change will ultimately modify Africa's economies and livelihoods, health, social structure, infrastructure and natural
systems. To date little has been done to empower, capacitate and mobilise youth, particularly in Africa to address global environmental challenges such as
climate change. facebook d o w n ~ To remedy this, an initial step has been the formation of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC).

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change was formed partially in response to the poor representation of young Africans at the International Youth
Summit on Climate Change (November 24-28, 2005), which was held in conjunction with the United Nation's Climate Change Conference (November 28-
December 10, 2005) in Montreal , Canada. The overall mission of AYICC is to ensure that African youth are equipped toparticipate in future UNFCCC
meetings and other global initiatives for sustainable solutions to environmental degradation and climate change.

In order to ensure a strong youth presence in climate change dialogue and fora, there is a need for AYICC to ensure youth representation from various parts
of Africa. This will enable Africa's youth to engage with the global youth movement, governments and NGO's in a more coordinated and sustained manner.
The long term goal is to ensure sustainable and systematic global youth action, with special emphasis on African youth on the issue of climate change.

Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any financial assistance. The planning committee members have
volunteered their time and their contributions. However, in order to make this vision a reality we need to become a financially viable organisation. For this
reason, we would like to request your financial assistance in getting this vision off the ground.•

                                                                                                                 O
As the 7th African Development Forum, we have indeed come of age, we are no longer in our childhood stages of determining sustainable development - the
time of maturity has arrived. This year is marked as the International Year of Youth and now, more than ever before, the youth are taking a stand. More than
anyone else, we, the Youth, face unprecedented challenges as a result of global climate change. We also share the responsibility of addressing ii. As a group,
we are key moral stakeholders in the international processes treating the most important challenge of our generation. As it is our future, we will be
disproportionately affected by the catastrophic impacts of climate change.

Advocacy and Behavior Change: II is critical for present and future leaders to collaborate on finding solutions. The need for cultural transformation in our time




                                                                              M
is stronger than ever. This transformation - that enables us to shift towards a more sustainable world - should be an organic process, guided by principles of
compassion, integrity and justice. We need to pragmatically rethink our behavioral patterns, to enable a paradigm shift that is based on an ongoing process of
action, reflection and meaningful participation. Awareness, education and empowerment are fundamental prerequisites to enabling this process, and the youth
are energetic and passionate about holding governments and all relevant stakeholders involved accountable for their actions. We are equal partners in this
process and commit ourselves fully to achieving the objectives as decided by this Forum.




                                                                            E
Contrary to what is believed; young people play a dynamic role in framing and implementing policies. So their role goes beyond advocacy. From an advocacy
perspective, young people are involved in songs and stories which spread awareness in local languages. Of course we understand the importance and
relevance of this because 70% of Africa is based in rural areas and the term Climate Change is foreign, Young people are finding ways of using words in local
languages to translate the message across.




                                                           D
It is time to shift the balance of decision-making towards the generation that will have to manage this unwanted inheritance, to make political and economic
decisions that can span a generation, and to enable real inter-generational and inter-cultural dialogue about climate change to be realized in institutions where
the youth generation can learn.

However at the same time a range of social learning and marketing approaches need to be developed to address the gap between classroom education styles
and education that stimulates real action. This gap prevents the cultural shift from token awareness to personal action and reaction.

Education: In relation to climate change, African Governments should begin at inception to mainstream youth voices and perceptions. This is particularly
important because climate change projections indicate that effects will begin to be most felt in the next 20-30 years - young people should begin to be part of
the solution so that they will be able to cope when disaster calls. Involving them in this programme will ensure that those who will be affected will have direct
knowledge of the challenges and strategies for coping as well as the ability to mobilize communities to respond to and prepare for the impact of climate change
and natural disasters.

Governments must give credence to the higher learning education system in Africa in particular the increased accent on improvement of research and
innovation on climate change specifically highlighting on policy and reform, the programmes, pedagogy and teaching tools. This will enhance an equipped pool
of intellectual capital among the young people on climate change issues who will replicate this to the various organizations and networks that they are part of.

Al government level, during the last Conference of the Parties (COP), ii was pleasing to see that many African delegations included youth and gave them a role
to play. Furthermore, many youth who were involved in COP 15 deliberations have been interacting with their various governments and engaging in processes
and procedures that are related to Climate change policy. There is an understanding that more needs to be done, and at this forum, I urge you to engage young
people who knock on your doors asking to be involved.

Youth and youth based NGOs play a major role either in strengthening local capacity to cope or by supporting local action. Already, groups such as the Nigerian
Youth Coalition and the African youth Climate Initiative-Kenya have established school climate clubs, which are creative ways to engage young people; these
initiatives should be mainstreamed into education systems. Young people in this governance process are important because successful adaptation requires a
host of innovative measures developed with vulnerable communities to improve their present and future livelihoods. Young people are vibrant and are able to
access places that many governmental institutions fail to access. As the majority of the population and Africa's future, it is important to include them in this
impending crisis that is Climate Change.

Already, this conference calls for integrated approaches to enable African countries to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change. There is a dire need
to have a clearer understanding of the potential calamities that climate change can bring and to start the discourse on how best to stave off the worst impacts.
There is already an understanding that

Climate Change is not a localized problem but transcends national borders, hence the need for co-operation of Intergovernmental agencies but also to include
those young and vulnerable people.

Conclusion :
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS092_OpenSocietyCivilSocietyLeadershipAwards_USA","No longer can climate change be seen as merely an environmental problem or an energy challenge. It is a combination of both, which needs the involvement of
young people to preserve the environment and enter into green energy careers.

It's important for all of us to recognize that sustainable development isn't just a catch phrase - people all over the continent are taking it into their own hands. A
couple days ago over 300 community events took place in nearly every country on the continent of Africa, and more than 7000 globally as part of the Global
Work Party on 10/10/10.

Everywhere in the wortd, people planted trees, cultivated community gardens, installed solar panels, made buildings more efficient and implemented thousands
of other grassroots solutions to the climate crisis. We got to work everywhere in the world, but we need you, leaders, to get to work, too.

Thank you and God bless

                        African Youth at COP25

                        by ayicc_admin · Published May 20, 2020 · Updated May 20, 2020
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS092_OpenSocietyCivilSocietyLeadershipAwards_USA","The 25th session of the Conference Parties (COP25) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held from the 2 -13
December bringing together nearly 27000 people to the Spanish capital. COP25
provided parties with the opportunity to finalize the ""rulebook"" of the Paris
Agreement - the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020.


In the spirit of the convention on climate change young people continue to enjoy




                                                                          O
various spaces during COP mainly through YOU NGO; the official youth
constituency to the UNFCCC. Article 6 ofthe Convention and Article 12 of the
Paris Agreement referred to as Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) encourage
the empowerment of every member of the society to take climate actions and
therefore young people who are most vulnerable to the climate crisis are




                                             M
increasingly becoming the centre of discussion.


The world today is home to the largest generation of young people in history and
their energy, creativity, and innovation, when harnessed properly, will accelerate




                                           E
sustainable solutions to the global crisis. Youth have a pivotal role to play in the
implementation of ACE which consists of six elements namely: education,
training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and
international cooperation.




                             D
At COP25, the Intergenerational Inquiry which is a highlight event of Young and
Future Generations Day and like every year provided a platform for youth and
decision-makers to discuss how young people can enhance the implementation
of the Paris Agreement. This platform was attended by the Executive Secretary of
the UNFCCC and provided an opportunity for young people to share the
outcome on the Conference of Youth (COY 15) to the secretariat.


The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) has continued to
empower and mobilize young people at COP through our side events and
exhibitions. Through an exhibition at COP 25, AYICC was able to showcase the
actions and contributions of African youth in the fight against climate change.
Such actions include ecological restorations, renewable energy promotion, and
local conference of youth hosted by our national chapters.


AYICC's greatest concern however, is with regards to the low representation of
African youth at the UNFCCC sessions. There are many contributing factors which
includes lack of funding, inability to assess accreditations and visas. As the first
step in addressing this, we will continue to encourage African countries to make
conscious efforts to include youth delegates in their official delegations for COPs.
We also call on development partners and stakeholders who are interested in
youth development to reach out with their support to AYICC to enhance African
youth participation in this important global process.

Climate Change


• Campaigns and Advocacy
 The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is widely known for our
 incessant campaigns and research-based advocacy on environmental and
 climate change topics. Since 2006 AYICC has been consistent with its
 campaigns impressing on African governments and international community
 alike to deliver on their commitment under the United Nations Framework
 Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) .



• Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)
 Climate change education, training, and awareness creation have been the
 central focus of AYICC targeting youth and vulnerable communities. We do
 this through workshops, conferences, and webinars leveraging on our robust
 online presence. Through our Flagship program; the African Youth Conference
 on Climate Change (AFRIYOCC) we are able to provide a platform for




                                                                     O
 exchange of ideas and sharing of knowledge and best practices among young
 African thereby feeding into article 6 of the climate change convention and
 article 12 of the Paris Agreement.



• Tree planting and Ecological restoration



                                         M
 Trees contribute to their environment by providing oxygen, improving air
 quality, climate amelioration, conserving water, preserving soil, and




                                       E
 supporting wildlife. Beyond the campaigns and advocacies, our member
 organizations embark on tree planting and reforestation activities including
 mangrove restoration along the coast.




                         D
• Renewable energy promotion
 With the increasing demand for energy for industrial and economic
 development, AYICC member organizations in different countries are
 promoting renewable energy access to isolated off-grid communities. AYICC
 believes that Youth-led renewable energy enterprises are a viable means of
 achieving sustainable development, as they promote technologies that are
 less harmful to the global environs while at the same time providing
 sustainable income-generating opportunities for youth .



• Youth in Agribusiness
 AYICC sees agriculture as an essential driver of economic development and an
 area of great opportunity for young people in Africa. The challenge, however,
 is that the growing youth population does not see agriculture as a profitable
 opportunity due to their lack of insight into the opportunities that exist within
 the agriculture value chain. Through our member organizations who are youth
 farmers themselves, AYICC has adopted various strategies including outreach
 to schools and communities, exhibitions and youth agricultural festivals as
 well as institution of award schemes for best youth farmers as a way to raise
 interest and awareness on the opportunities that exist within this sector.



• Recycling

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS092_OpenSocietyCivilSocietyLeadershipAwards_USA","                            Over recent years, the world has witnessed an increasing level of waste
                            products as a by-product of the increasing level of population, affluence, and
                            technological advancement in a given environment or society. In Africa we
                            have witnessed increasing level of pollution from plastic, car tires, bottles
                            among others and this has generated innovative thinking among young
                            people to provide a sustainable solution. Over the years, AYICC members have
                            redefined waste as a resource for sustainable development and through
                            various recycling initiatives, they are bringing life into materials that otherwise
                            could have been a nuisance to the environment.

The 1st African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) convened from 26th - 27th
October, 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, on the theme “African Youth Responses to Climate
Change and Food Security, Action from the Frontline.” The conference was organized by Africa
Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) in partnership with Africa Climate Policy Center
(ACPC), New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), Pan African Climate Justice
Alliance (PACJA) and Zimbabwe United Nations Association (ZUNA).
100 youths selected across Africa in the conference addressing the thematic strands of Youth in
Agribusiness; Climate Change and Development in Africa; Sustainable Agriculture and Food
Security; Green Economy and Technology Transfer; Climate Justice and Human Rights; and
Climate Change and Disaster risk reduction participated in this first edition of the African Youth
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC). This came at a time when Africa as a continent
continues to bear the biggest brunt of climate change due to low resilience and weak capacities,
with the youth despite their huge numbers and innovativeness among the vulnerable alongside
women. Despite the odds, they have been actively engaged in adaptation and mitigation




                                                                   O
initiatives that improve their communities’ resilience to climate change.
The conference therefore provided a platform for the African youths to interact and share best
practices. Five flagship projects were selected to be used as case studies by African Youths in
starting their own projects depending on transferability. The conference also saw the drafting of

(AfriYOCC-2016)

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the environmental challenge of climate
change is already modifying Africa’s economies and livelihoods, health, social structure,
infrastructure and natural systems. Over the years, African youth have proved their potential in
both promoting and implementing climate change adaptation projects in their communities.
Their innovations have continually been adopted in responding to climate change impacts. This
is despite various challenges that include low capacity and education, high rates of poverty and
lack of financial resources. At the same time, African youth have been minimally represented in
the respective country policy processes as well as during the UNFCCC climate change
negotiations. Above 50% of the African population are the youth. This justifies the urgent need
for youth capacity development to respond to climate change and inclusion as key stakeholders
in policy process and negotiations. AYICC aims to spearhead new innovations, look into new
systems of success to share with policy and decision-makers, and generally aim to improve on
the current system which is causing long-term and irreversible degradation to our livelihoods –
as the leading youth organization on climate change in Africa.



                                                                    O
In cognizance of the role and potential of the African youth in climate change mitigation and
adaptation and overall sustainable development trajectory, the second African Youth

October, 2016 as AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its formation in 2006 during the
second Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12. Building on the success of the first

edition of conference, AfriYOCC shall provide an avenue for African youths to showcase their
climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, projects and initiatives. Best practices
arising from the various AYICC country chapters shall be developed to an African youth

meeting will dilate on the current post 2015 development agenda and the role of young
people in championing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in
Africa.

The delegates shall have an opportunity to visit ongoing Climate Change adaptation and
agribusiness projects in Kenya for hands-on skills and knowledge replicable in their countries.
Consequently, it shall boost the skills and capacities of African youths to substantially contribute
to the process leading towards and during COP 22. Through partnership with both
Governmental and Non-governmental agencies, the conference shall not only negotiate for
more youth representation in the respective country policy processes towards the forthcoming
CoPs and country specific policies, but also provide learning and engagement opportunities for
African youths. This will greatly enhance their current capacity and potential to actively
participate in both national and international platforms for policy formulation and implementation.
The conference will also provide a platform to re-assess the current position of our negotiators
and create awareness about the critical role young people should play in shifting agendas in the
forthcoming Conference of Parties in Marrakech come November 2016. While a 4 day gathering

issues affecting their livelihoods.

African youth have for long been side-lined to the periphery of the substantive civic and policy
issues facing the continent. However, the worst affected are the rural based youths and those
residing in farming communities, peri-urban areas and those from conflict and post conflict
countries. This has resulted in youths from these marginalized communities having no
knowledge and information on the basic climate change science and adaptation and mitigation
mechanisms. The good news though is that there is capacity amongst many young people who
are already in the circles of upcoming academia, policy specialists, lawyers, journalists and
scientists’ alike. These capacities need to be strengthened and skills shared amongst the wider
group of young people on the continent so that best practices are disseminated and resources
are expanded.

While it is an undeniable fact that climate change is affecting all regions globally, especially in
developing countries, the adverse effects in the future is likely to increase if the Paris agreement
is not ratified and effectuated by all parties. And even though a deal was achieved during
COP21 in Paris, the impacts of climate change will definitely continue into the future. This
suggests that young people will have to not just understand what climate change is and how it is




                                                                      O
affecting our world, opportunities that exists within, but most importantly, participate actively into
finding amicable solutions. Young people of Africa have therefore considered it an inherent
imperative to contribute to their future by organizing the 2nd African Youth Conference on
Climate Change in October 2016 under the theme, ‘Making Climate Finance work for




                                                  M
African Youth.’


2.1 CONFERENCE STRATEGY




                                                E
The conference program shall be based on exploring mechanisms to finance climate adaptation
and mitigation through Innovations in agriculture, technology and other sectors. It shall be




                                     D
highly interactive with unique workshop-style design that enables participants to develop their
potential through practical experience. Participants will divide to participate in thematic
workshops and come up with an African Youth position paper and concrete activities to be
included in the African Youth Strategy on Climate Change.

The delegates shall be engaged in pre-conference activities that shall include and not limited to,
mapping of youth climate change and/or mitigation projects within the conference key focus
areas for selection as best practice and include in the African youth climate change adaptation
and mitigation best practices database and handbook and aggressively fundraise towards their
participation and a successful workshop. The conference shall critically examine the various
country positions and the overall continents positions of the African Group of Negotiators, their
achievements and potentials towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It shall
examine the youth voices in these positions and further develop African youth position for

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is an umbrella youth network of African
based youth organizations, university groups, rural youth groups, schools, and individuals
working on climate change and sustainable development issues. It aims at developing capacity
and strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent need to take action
against the impacts of climate change for both present and future generations.

The initiative (always referred to as the movement) was conceived in Nairobi Kenya 10 years
ago, during the second Conference of Youth (COY2) preceding the 12th Conference of Parties
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC - COP12). The
main reason for its founding was to ensure the inclusion, and active participation of youths from
the south, and specifically Africa, in the international climate change negotiations. This was
needed as the youth are more than half the African population and are most affected by climate
change impacts. They also got massive potential to support the continent to take action on
global warming.

During its formation, it comprised of 8 country chapters and current has grown to 45 country
chapters with over 20,000 members across Africa and the Diaspora. This initiative has provided




                                                                  O
a platform for knowledge, ideas and experiences sharing. It is also an avenue for development
of skills and strategies on youth action on climate change mitigation and adaptation in the
African continent. AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a
platform for them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the




                                               M
UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others.

Since its inception, we have worked in partnership with international youth movements and have




                                             E
played a great role in the establishment of the International Youth Climate Movement whose
youth member organizations are now officially acknowledged by the UNFCCC as the YOUNGO
(Youth NGOs involved in the climate change negotiations process). Since COY2 in Nairobi, it




                                   D
has had youth delegates’ representation in all COP meetings.

In addition to the above, we have had landmark successes that include:
     A reach out programme for a children’s home (Watoto Wema in Ruai) and School
        climate change education program run in selected schools in Kenya.
     Leadership and mentorship programmes especially on volunteerism.
     Community development projects particularly on clean energy (energy saving stoves for
        rural folks)
     Capacity development of youth on agribusiness
     Advocacy campaigns e.g. lobbied for lanes to be set aside along the major highways for
        non-motorised transport especially for cyclists.
     Policy engagements i.e. contributing to the climate change bill 2012,as stakeholders
     Youth Caravan from Kenya to Durban during COP 17

Our charter (Charter of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change) can be found on
www.ayicc.net.
Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any
financial assistance, the greatest resource being the time and skills that the leadership
committee and members contribute. However, in order to scale up our actions and make AYICC
vision a reality, there is need for more human and financial resources.

Founding Opportunities


AYICC Founding Opportunities

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the
environmental challenge of climate change will ultimately modify Africa's economies and livelihoods, health, social structure, infrastructure and natural
systems. To date little has been done to empower, capacitate and mobilise youth, particularly in Africa to address global environmental challenges such as
climate change. facebook d o w n ~ To remedy this, an initial step has been the formation of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC).

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change was formed partially in response to the poor representation of young Africans at the International Youth
Summit on Climate Change (November 24-28, 2005), which was held in conjunction with the United Nation's Climate Change Conference (November 28-
December 10, 2005) in Montreal , Canada. The overall mission of AYICC is to ensure that African youth are equipped toparticipate in future UNFCCC
meetings and other global initiatives for sustainable solutions to environmental degradation and climate change.

In order to ensure a strong youth presence in climate change dialogue and fora, there is a need for AYICC to ensure youth representation from various parts
of Africa. This will enable Africa's youth to engage with the global youth movement, governments and NGO's in a more coordinated and sustained manner.
The long term goal is to ensure sustainable and systematic global youth action, with special emphasis on African youth on the issue of climate change.

Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any financial assistance. The planning committee members have
volunteered their time and their contributions. However, in order to make this vision a reality we need to become a financially viable organisation. For this
reason, we would like to request your financial assistance in getting this vision off the ground.•

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE OPENING FORUM OF THE SEVENTH AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FORUM, 12TH OCTOBER

2010: Ms. Esther Agbarakwe, Nigeria




The Chair,

Climate Change poses significant challenges to future generations. As youth we have a stake in this future; it is our future.




                                                                                                                 O
As the 7th African Development Forum, we have indeed come of age, we are no longer in our childhood stages of determining sustainable development - the
time of maturity has arrived. This year is marked as the International Year of Youth and now, more than ever before, the youth are taking a stand. More than
anyone else, we, the Youth, face unprecedented challenges as a result of global climate change. We also share the responsibility of addressing ii. As a group,
we are key moral stakeholders in the international processes treating the most important challenge of our generation. As it is our future, we will be
disproportionately affected by the catastrophic impacts of climate change.

Advocacy and Behavior Change: II is critical for present and future leaders to collaborate on finding solutions. The need for cultural transformation in our time




                                                                              M
is stronger than ever. This transformation - that enables us to shift towards a more sustainable world - should be an organic process, guided by principles of
compassion, integrity and justice. We need to pragmatically rethink our behavioral patterns, to enable a paradigm shift that is based on an ongoing process of
action, reflection and meaningful participation. Awareness, education and empowerment are fundamental prerequisites to enabling this process, and the youth
are energetic and passionate about holding governments and all relevant stakeholders involved accountable for their actions. We are equal partners in this
process and commit ourselves fully to achieving the objectives as decided by this Forum.




                                                                            E
Contrary to what is believed; young people play a dynamic role in framing and implementing policies. So their role goes beyond advocacy. From an advocacy
perspective, young people are involved in songs and stories which spread awareness in local languages. Of course we understand the importance and
relevance of this because 70% of Africa is based in rural areas and the term Climate Change is foreign, Young people are finding ways of using words in local
languages to translate the message across.




                                                           D
It is time to shift the balance of decision-making towards the generation that will have to manage this unwanted inheritance, to make political and economic
decisions that can span a generation, and to enable real inter-generational and inter-cultural dialogue about climate change to be realized in institutions where
the youth generation can learn.

However at the same time a range of social learning and marketing approaches need to be developed to address the gap between classroom education styles
and education that stimulates real action. This gap prevents the cultural shift from token awareness to personal action and reaction.

Education: In relation to climate change, African Governments should begin at inception to mainstream youth voices and perceptions. This is particularly
important because climate change projections indicate that effects will begin to be most felt in the next 20-30 years - young people should begin to be part of
the solution so that they will be able to cope when disaster calls. Involving them in this programme will ensure that those who will be affected will have direct
knowledge of the challenges and strategies for coping as well as the ability to mobilize communities to respond to and prepare for the impact of climate change
and natural disasters.

Governments must give credence to the higher learning education system in Africa in particular the increased accent on improvement of research and
innovation on climate change specifically highlighting on policy and reform, the programmes, pedagogy and teaching tools. This will enhance an equipped pool
of intellectual capital among the young people on climate change issues who will replicate this to the various organizations and networks that they are part of.

Al government level, during the last Conference of the Parties (COP), ii was pleasing to see that many African delegations included youth and gave them a role
to play. Furthermore, many youth who were involved in COP 15 deliberations have been interacting with their various governments and engaging in processes
and procedures that are related to Climate change policy. There is an understanding that more needs to be done, and at this forum, I urge you to engage young
people who knock on your doors asking to be involved.

Youth and youth based NGOs play a major role either in strengthening local capacity to cope or by supporting local action. Already, groups such as the Nigerian
Youth Coalition and the African youth Climate Initiative-Kenya have established school climate clubs, which are creative ways to engage young people; these
initiatives should be mainstreamed into education systems. Young people in this governance process are important because successful adaptation requires a
host of innovative measures developed with vulnerable communities to improve their present and future livelihoods. Young people are vibrant and are able to
access places that many governmental institutions fail to access. As the majority of the population and Africa's future, it is important to include them in this
impending crisis that is Climate Change.

Already, this conference calls for integrated approaches to enable African countries to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change. There is a dire need
to have a clearer understanding of the potential calamities that climate change can bring and to start the discourse on how best to stave off the worst impacts.
There is already an understanding that

Climate Change is not a localized problem but transcends national borders, hence the need for co-operation of Intergovernmental agencies but also to include
those young and vulnerable people.

Conclusion :
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS093_CommonwealthScholarship","No longer can climate change be seen as merely an environmental problem or an energy challenge. It is a combination of both, which needs the involvement of
young people to preserve the environment and enter into green energy careers.

It's important for all of us to recognize that sustainable development isn't just a catch phrase - people all over the continent are taking it into their own hands. A
couple days ago over 300 community events took place in nearly every country on the continent of Africa, and more than 7000 globally as part of the Global
Work Party on 10/10/10.

Everywhere in the wortd, people planted trees, cultivated community gardens, installed solar panels, made buildings more efficient and implemented thousands
of other grassroots solutions to the climate crisis. We got to work everywhere in the world, but we need you, leaders, to get to work, too.

Thank you and God bless

                        African Youth at COP25

                        by ayicc_admin · Published May 20, 2020 · Updated May 20, 2020
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS093_CommonwealthScholarship","The 25th session of the Conference Parties (COP25) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held from the 2 -13
December bringing together nearly 27000 people to the Spanish capital. COP25
provided parties with the opportunity to finalize the ""rulebook"" of the Paris
Agreement - the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020.


In the spirit of the convention on climate change young people continue to enjoy




                                                                          O
various spaces during COP mainly through YOU NGO; the official youth
constituency to the UNFCCC. Article 6 ofthe Convention and Article 12 of the
Paris Agreement referred to as Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) encourage
the empowerment of every member of the society to take climate actions and
therefore young people who are most vulnerable to the climate crisis are




                                             M
increasingly becoming the centre of discussion.


The world today is home to the largest generation of young people in history and
their energy, creativity, and innovation, when harnessed properly, will accelerate




                                           E
sustainable solutions to the global crisis. Youth have a pivotal role to play in the
implementation of ACE which consists of six elements namely: education,
training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and
international cooperation.




                             D
At COP25, the Intergenerational Inquiry which is a highlight event of Young and
Future Generations Day and like every year provided a platform for youth and
decision-makers to discuss how young people can enhance the implementation
of the Paris Agreement. This platform was attended by the Executive Secretary of
the UNFCCC and provided an opportunity for young people to share the
outcome on the Conference of Youth (COY 15) to the secretariat.


The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) has continued to
empower and mobilize young people at COP through our side events and
exhibitions. Through an exhibition at COP 25, AYICC was able to showcase the
actions and contributions of African youth in the fight against climate change.
Such actions include ecological restorations, renewable energy promotion, and
local conference of youth hosted by our national chapters.


AYICC's greatest concern however, is with regards to the low representation of
African youth at the UNFCCC sessions. There are many contributing factors which
includes lack of funding, inability to assess accreditations and visas. As the first
step in addressing this, we will continue to encourage African countries to make
conscious efforts to include youth delegates in their official delegations for COPs.
We also call on development partners and stakeholders who are interested in
youth development to reach out with their support to AYICC to enhance African
youth participation in this important global process.

Climate Change


• Campaigns and Advocacy
 The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is widely known for our
 incessant campaigns and research-based advocacy on environmental and
 climate change topics. Since 2006 AYICC has been consistent with its
 campaigns impressing on African governments and international community
 alike to deliver on their commitment under the United Nations Framework
 Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) .



• Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)
 Climate change education, training, and awareness creation have been the
 central focus of AYICC targeting youth and vulnerable communities. We do
 this through workshops, conferences, and webinars leveraging on our robust
 online presence. Through our Flagship program; the African Youth Conference
 on Climate Change (AFRIYOCC) we are able to provide a platform for




                                                                     O
 exchange of ideas and sharing of knowledge and best practices among young
 African thereby feeding into article 6 of the climate change convention and
 article 12 of the Paris Agreement.



• Tree planting and Ecological restoration



                                         M
 Trees contribute to their environment by providing oxygen, improving air
 quality, climate amelioration, conserving water, preserving soil, and




                                       E
 supporting wildlife. Beyond the campaigns and advocacies, our member
 organizations embark on tree planting and reforestation activities including
 mangrove restoration along the coast.




                         D
• Renewable energy promotion
 With the increasing demand for energy for industrial and economic
 development, AYICC member organizations in different countries are
 promoting renewable energy access to isolated off-grid communities. AYICC
 believes that Youth-led renewable energy enterprises are a viable means of
 achieving sustainable development, as they promote technologies that are
 less harmful to the global environs while at the same time providing
 sustainable income-generating opportunities for youth .



• Youth in Agribusiness
 AYICC sees agriculture as an essential driver of economic development and an
 area of great opportunity for young people in Africa. The challenge, however,
 is that the growing youth population does not see agriculture as a profitable
 opportunity due to their lack of insight into the opportunities that exist within
 the agriculture value chain. Through our member organizations who are youth
 farmers themselves, AYICC has adopted various strategies including outreach
 to schools and communities, exhibitions and youth agricultural festivals as
 well as institution of award schemes for best youth farmers as a way to raise
 interest and awareness on the opportunities that exist within this sector.



• Recycling

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS093_CommonwealthScholarship","                            Over recent years, the world has witnessed an increasing level of waste
                            products as a by-product of the increasing level of population, affluence, and
                            technological advancement in a given environment or society. In Africa we
                            have witnessed increasing level of pollution from plastic, car tires, bottles
                            among others and this has generated innovative thinking among young
                            people to provide a sustainable solution. Over the years, AYICC members have
                            redefined waste as a resource for sustainable development and through
                            various recycling initiatives, they are bringing life into materials that otherwise
                            could have been a nuisance to the environment.

The 1st African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) convened from 26th - 27th
October, 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, on the theme “African Youth Responses to Climate
Change and Food Security, Action from the Frontline.” The conference was organized by Africa
Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) in partnership with Africa Climate Policy Center
(ACPC), New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), Pan African Climate Justice
Alliance (PACJA) and Zimbabwe United Nations Association (ZUNA).
100 youths selected across Africa in the conference addressing the thematic strands of Youth in
Agribusiness; Climate Change and Development in Africa; Sustainable Agriculture and Food
Security; Green Economy and Technology Transfer; Climate Justice and Human Rights; and
Climate Change and Disaster risk reduction participated in this first edition of the African Youth
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC). This came at a time when Africa as a continent
continues to bear the biggest brunt of climate change due to low resilience and weak capacities,
with the youth despite their huge numbers and innovativeness among the vulnerable alongside
women. Despite the odds, they have been actively engaged in adaptation and mitigation




                                                                   O
initiatives that improve their communities’ resilience to climate change.
The conference therefore provided a platform for the African youths to interact and share best
practices. Five flagship projects were selected to be used as case studies by African Youths in
starting their own projects depending on transferability. The conference also saw the drafting of

(AfriYOCC-2016)

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the environmental challenge of climate
change is already modifying Africa’s economies and livelihoods, health, social structure,
infrastructure and natural systems. Over the years, African youth have proved their potential in
both promoting and implementing climate change adaptation projects in their communities.
Their innovations have continually been adopted in responding to climate change impacts. This
is despite various challenges that include low capacity and education, high rates of poverty and
lack of financial resources. At the same time, African youth have been minimally represented in
the respective country policy processes as well as during the UNFCCC climate change
negotiations. Above 50% of the African population are the youth. This justifies the urgent need
for youth capacity development to respond to climate change and inclusion as key stakeholders
in policy process and negotiations. AYICC aims to spearhead new innovations, look into new
systems of success to share with policy and decision-makers, and generally aim to improve on
the current system which is causing long-term and irreversible degradation to our livelihoods –
as the leading youth organization on climate change in Africa.



                                                                    O
In cognizance of the role and potential of the African youth in climate change mitigation and
adaptation and overall sustainable development trajectory, the second African Youth

October, 2016 as AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its formation in 2006 during the
second Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12. Building on the success of the first

edition of conference, AfriYOCC shall provide an avenue for African youths to showcase their
climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, projects and initiatives. Best practices
arising from the various AYICC country chapters shall be developed to an African youth

climate change adaptation and mitigation best practices database and handbook. The
meeting will dilate on the current post 2015 development agenda and the role of young
people in championing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in
Africa.

The delegates shall have an opportunity to visit ongoing Climate Change adaptation and
agribusiness projects in Kenya for hands-on skills and knowledge replicable in their countries.
Consequently, it shall boost the skills and capacities of African youths to substantially contribute
to the process leading towards and during COP 22. Through partnership with both
Governmental and Non-governmental agencies, the conference shall not only negotiate for
more youth representation in the respective country policy processes towards the forthcoming
CoPs and country specific policies, but also provide learning and engagement opportunities for
African youths. This will greatly enhance their current capacity and potential to actively
participate in both national and international platforms for policy formulation and implementation.
The conference will also provide a platform to re-assess the current position of our negotiators
and create awareness about the critical role young people should play in shifting agendas in the
forthcoming Conference of Parties in Marrakech come November 2016. While a 4 day gathering

issues affecting their livelihoods.

African youth have for long been side-lined to the periphery of the substantive civic and policy
issues facing the continent. However, the worst affected are the rural based youths and those
residing in farming communities, peri-urban areas and those from conflict and post conflict
countries. This has resulted in youths from these marginalized communities having no
knowledge and information on the basic climate change science and adaptation and mitigation
mechanisms. The good news though is that there is capacity amongst many young people who
are already in the circles of upcoming academia, policy specialists, lawyers, journalists and
scientists’ alike. These capacities need to be strengthened and skills shared amongst the wider
group of young people on the continent so that best practices are disseminated and resources
are expanded.

While it is an undeniable fact that climate change is affecting all regions globally, especially in
developing countries, the adverse effects in the future is likely to increase if the Paris agreement
is not ratified and effectuated by all parties. And even though a deal was achieved during
COP21 in Paris, the impacts of climate change will definitely continue into the future. This
suggests that young people will have to not just understand what climate change is and how it is




                                                                      O
affecting our world, opportunities that exists within, but most importantly, participate actively into
finding amicable solutions. Young people of Africa have therefore considered it an inherent
imperative to contribute to their future by organizing the 2nd African Youth Conference on
Climate Change in October 2016 under the theme, ‘Making Climate Finance work for




                                                  M
African Youth.’

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is an umbrella youth network of African
based youth organizations, university groups, rural youth groups, schools, and individuals
working on climate change and sustainable development issues. It aims at developing capacity
and strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent need to take action
against the impacts of climate change for both present and future generations.

The initiative (always referred to as the movement) was conceived in Nairobi Kenya 10 years
ago, during the second Conference of Youth (COY2) preceding the 12th Conference of Parties
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC - COP12). The
main reason for its founding was to ensure the inclusion, and active participation of youths from
the south, and specifically Africa, in the international climate change negotiations. This was
needed as the youth are more than half the African population and are most affected by climate
change impacts. They also got massive potential to support the continent to take action on
global warming.

During its formation, it comprised of 8 country chapters and current has grown to 45 country
chapters with over 20,000 members across Africa and the Diaspora. This initiative has provided




                                                                  O
a platform for knowledge, ideas and experiences sharing. It is also an avenue for development
of skills and strategies on youth action on climate change mitigation and adaptation in the
African continent. AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a
platform for them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the




                                               M
UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others.

Since its inception, we have worked in partnership with international youth movements and have




                                             E
played a great role in the establishment of the International Youth Climate Movement whose
youth member organizations are now officially acknowledged by the UNFCCC as the YOUNGO
(Youth NGOs involved in the climate change negotiations process). Since COY2 in Nairobi, it




                                   D
has had youth delegates’ representation in all COP meetings.

In addition to the above, we have had landmark successes that include:
     A reach out programme for a children’s home (Watoto Wema in Ruai) and School
        climate change education program run in selected schools in Kenya.
     Leadership and mentorship programmes especially on volunteerism.
     Community development projects particularly on clean energy (energy saving stoves for
        rural folks)
     Capacity development of youth on agribusiness
     Advocacy campaigns e.g. lobbied for lanes to be set aside along the major highways for
        non-motorised transport especially for cyclists.
     Policy engagements i.e. contributing to the climate change bill 2012,as stakeholders
     Youth Caravan from Kenya to Durban during COP 17

Our charter (Charter of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change) can be found on
www.ayicc.net.
Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any
financial assistance, the greatest resource being the time and skills that the leadership
committee and members contribute. However, in order to scale up our actions and make AYICC
vision a reality, there is need for more human and financial resources.

African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) 2016

African Youth Conference on Climate Change will take place in Nairobi in Kenya. The conference is organized by the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change
(AYICC) and the African Climate Policy Centre from the 10 to 13 October 2016. AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its fonmation in 2006 during the second
Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12.

African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) www.ayicc.net is a continental youth network that was conceived in 2006 in Nairobi Kenya, during the
Conference of Youth held just before the UNFCCC COP12. This initiative has continued to link, and share knowledge, ideas, experiences, skills and strategies
on youth action around the continent on climate change, its mitigation and adaptation and sustainable development. In 2009, AYICC was granted observer
status to the African Minister Conference on Environment (AMCEN). AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a platform for
them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the Conference of Parties of UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others. AYICC
currently operates in over 45 African countries with over 20,000 members.

In response, to the call by AU Heads of Sates and Government to establish the CAHOSCC Youth Programme on Climate Change (CYPCC),
(Assembly/AU/Dec.538{XXIII}) and cognizant of the key role played by African youths in climate change mitigation and adaptation and overall sustainable
development. AYICC is convening the Second African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) from the 10 to 13 October 2016, after the successful
hosting of the first edition held from 26th to 27th October 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimababwe.       ~


AfriYOCC 2016, shall provide an avenue for African youths to showcase their climate change adaptation
and mitigation strategies, projects and initiatives. Best practices arising from the various AYICC country
chapters shall be showcased and the African youth climate change adaptation and mitigation best

Founding Opportunities


AYICC Founding Opportunities

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the
environmental challenge of climate change will ultimately modify Africa's economies and livelihoods, health, social structure, infrastructure and natural
systems. To date little has been done to empower, capacitate and mobilise youth, particularly in Africa to address global environmental challenges such as
climate change. facebook d o w n ~ To remedy this, an initial step has been the formation of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC).

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change was formed partially in response to the poor representation of young Africans at the International Youth
Summit on Climate Change (November 24-28, 2005), which was held in conjunction with the United Nation's Climate Change Conference (November 28-
December 10, 2005) in Montreal , Canada. The overall mission of AYICC is to ensure that African youth are equipped toparticipate in future UNFCCC
meetings and other global initiatives for sustainable solutions to environmental degradation and climate change.

In order to ensure a strong youth presence in climate change dialogue and fora, there is a need for AYICC to ensure youth representation from various parts
of Africa. This will enable Africa's youth to engage with the global youth movement, governments and NGO's in a more coordinated and sustained manner.
The long term goal is to ensure sustainable and systematic global youth action, with special emphasis on African youth on the issue of climate change.

Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any financial assistance. The planning committee members have
volunteered their time and their contributions. However, in order to make this vision a reality we need to become a financially viable organisation. For this
reason, we would like to request your financial assistance in getting this vision off the ground.•

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE OPENING FORUM OF THE SEVENTH AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FORUM, 12TH OCTOBER

2010: Ms. Esther Agbarakwe, Nigeria




The Chair,

Climate Change poses significant challenges to future generations. As youth we have a stake in this future; it is our future.




                                                                                                                 O
As the 7th African Development Forum, we have indeed come of age, we are no longer in our childhood stages of determining sustainable development - the
time of maturity has arrived. This year is marked as the International Year of Youth and now, more than ever before, the youth are taking a stand. More than
anyone else, we, the Youth, face unprecedented challenges as a result of global climate change. We also share the responsibility of addressing ii. As a group,
we are key moral stakeholders in the international processes treating the most important challenge of our generation. As it is our future, we will be
disproportionately affected by the catastrophic impacts of climate change.

Advocacy and Behavior Change: II is critical for present and future leaders to collaborate on finding solutions. The need for cultural transformation in our time




                                                                              M
is stronger than ever. This transformation - that enables us to shift towards a more sustainable world - should be an organic process, guided by principles of
compassion, integrity and justice. We need to pragmatically rethink our behavioral patterns, to enable a paradigm shift that is based on an ongoing process of
action, reflection and meaningful participation. Awareness, education and empowerment are fundamental prerequisites to enabling this process, and the youth
are energetic and passionate about holding governments and all relevant stakeholders involved accountable for their actions. We are equal partners in this
process and commit ourselves fully to achieving the objectives as decided by this Forum.




                                                                            E
Contrary to what is believed; young people play a dynamic role in framing and implementing policies. So their role goes beyond advocacy. From an advocacy
perspective, young people are involved in songs and stories which spread awareness in local languages. Of course we understand the importance and
relevance of this because 70% of Africa is based in rural areas and the term Climate Change is foreign, Young people are finding ways of using words in local
languages to translate the message across.




                                                           D
It is time to shift the balance of decision-making towards the generation that will have to manage this unwanted inheritance, to make political and economic
decisions that can span a generation, and to enable real inter-generational and inter-cultural dialogue about climate change to be realized in institutions where
the youth generation can learn.

However at the same time a range of social learning and marketing approaches need to be developed to address the gap between classroom education styles
and education that stimulates real action. This gap prevents the cultural shift from token awareness to personal action and reaction.

Education: In relation to climate change, African Governments should begin at inception to mainstream youth voices and perceptions. This is particularly
important because climate change projections indicate that effects will begin to be most felt in the next 20-30 years - young people should begin to be part of
the solution so that they will be able to cope when disaster calls. Involving them in this programme will ensure that those who will be affected will have direct
knowledge of the challenges and strategies for coping as well as the ability to mobilize communities to respond to and prepare for the impact of climate change
and natural disasters.

Governments must give credence to the higher learning education system in Africa in particular the increased accent on improvement of research and
innovation on climate change specifically highlighting on policy and reform, the programmes, pedagogy and teaching tools. This will enhance an equipped pool
of intellectual capital among the young people on climate change issues who will replicate this to the various organizations and networks that they are part of.

Al government level, during the last Conference of the Parties (COP), ii was pleasing to see that many African delegations included youth and gave them a role
to play. Furthermore, many youth who were involved in COP 15 deliberations have been interacting with their various governments and engaging in processes
and procedures that are related to Climate change policy. There is an understanding that more needs to be done, and at this forum, I urge you to engage young
people who knock on your doors asking to be involved.

Youth and youth based NGOs play a major role either in strengthening local capacity to cope or by supporting local action. Already, groups such as the Nigerian
Youth Coalition and the African youth Climate Initiative-Kenya have established school climate clubs, which are creative ways to engage young people; these
initiatives should be mainstreamed into education systems. Young people in this governance process are important because successful adaptation requires a
host of innovative measures developed with vulnerable communities to improve their present and future livelihoods. Young people are vibrant and are able to
access places that many governmental institutions fail to access. As the majority of the population and Africa's future, it is important to include them in this
impending crisis that is Climate Change.

Already, this conference calls for integrated approaches to enable African countries to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change. There is a dire need
to have a clearer understanding of the potential calamities that climate change can bring and to start the discourse on how best to stave off the worst impacts.
There is already an understanding that

Climate Change is not a localized problem but transcends national borders, hence the need for co-operation of Intergovernmental agencies but also to include
those young and vulnerable people.

Conclusion :
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS136_KectilGeneration","No longer can climate change be seen as merely an environmental problem or an energy challenge. It is a combination of both, which needs the involvement of
young people to preserve the environment and enter into green energy careers.

It's important for all of us to recognize that sustainable development isn't just a catch phrase - people all over the continent are taking it into their own hands. A
couple days ago over 300 community events took place in nearly every country on the continent of Africa, and more than 7000 globally as part of the Global
Work Party on 10/10/10.

Everywhere in the wortd, people planted trees, cultivated community gardens, installed solar panels, made buildings more efficient and implemented thousands
of other grassroots solutions to the climate crisis. We got to work everywhere in the world, but we need you, leaders, to get to work, too.

Thank you and God bless

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS136_KectilGeneration","The 25th session of the Conference Parties (COP25) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held from the 2 -13
December bringing together nearly 27000 people to the Spanish capital. COP25
provided parties with the opportunity to finalize the ""rulebook"" of the Paris
Agreement - the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020.


In the spirit of the convention on climate change young people continue to enjoy




                                                                          O
various spaces during COP mainly through YOU NGO; the official youth
constituency to the UNFCCC. Article 6 ofthe Convention and Article 12 of the
Paris Agreement referred to as Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) encourage
the empowerment of every member of the society to take climate actions and
therefore young people who are most vulnerable to the climate crisis are




                                             M
increasingly becoming the centre of discussion.


The world today is home to the largest generation of young people in history and
their energy, creativity, and innovation, when harnessed properly, will accelerate




                                           E
sustainable solutions to the global crisis. Youth have a pivotal role to play in the
implementation of ACE which consists of six elements namely: education,
training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and
international cooperation.




                             D
At COP25, the Intergenerational Inquiry which is a highlight event of Young and
Future Generations Day and like every year provided a platform for youth and
decision-makers to discuss how young people can enhance the implementation
of the Paris Agreement. This platform was attended by the Executive Secretary of
the UNFCCC and provided an opportunity for young people to share the
outcome on the Conference of Youth (COY 15) to the secretariat.


The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) has continued to
empower and mobilize young people at COP through our side events and
exhibitions. Through an exhibition at COP 25, AYICC was able to showcase the
actions and contributions of African youth in the fight against climate change.
Such actions include ecological restorations, renewable energy promotion, and
local conference of youth hosted by our national chapters.


AYICC's greatest concern however, is with regards to the low representation of
African youth at the UNFCCC sessions. There are many contributing factors which
includes lack of funding, inability to assess accreditations and visas. As the first
step in addressing this, we will continue to encourage African countries to make
conscious efforts to include youth delegates in their official delegations for COPs.
We also call on development partners and stakeholders who are interested in
youth development to reach out with their support to AYICC to enhance African
youth participation in this important global process.

Climate Change


• Campaigns and Advocacy
 The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is widely known for our
 incessant campaigns and research-based advocacy on environmental and
 climate change topics. Since 2006 AYICC has been consistent with its
 campaigns impressing on African governments and international community
 alike to deliver on their commitment under the United Nations Framework
 Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) .



• Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)
 Climate change education, training, and awareness creation have been the
 central focus of AYICC targeting youth and vulnerable communities. We do
 this through workshops, conferences, and webinars leveraging on our robust
 online presence. Through our Flagship program; the African Youth Conference
 on Climate Change (AFRIYOCC) we are able to provide a platform for




                                                                     O
 exchange of ideas and sharing of knowledge and best practices among young
 African thereby feeding into article 6 of the climate change convention and
 article 12 of the Paris Agreement.



• Tree planting and Ecological restoration



                                         M
 Trees contribute to their environment by providing oxygen, improving air
 quality, climate amelioration, conserving water, preserving soil, and




                                       E
 supporting wildlife. Beyond the campaigns and advocacies, our member
 organizations embark on tree planting and reforestation activities including
 mangrove restoration along the coast.




                         D
• Renewable energy promotion
 With the increasing demand for energy for industrial and economic
 development, AYICC member organizations in different countries are
 promoting renewable energy access to isolated off-grid communities. AYICC
 believes that Youth-led renewable energy enterprises are a viable means of
 achieving sustainable development, as they promote technologies that are
 less harmful to the global environs while at the same time providing
 sustainable income-generating opportunities for youth .



• Youth in Agribusiness
 AYICC sees agriculture as an essential driver of economic development and an
 area of great opportunity for young people in Africa. The challenge, however,
 is that the growing youth population does not see agriculture as a profitable
 opportunity due to their lack of insight into the opportunities that exist within
 the agriculture value chain. Through our member organizations who are youth
 farmers themselves, AYICC has adopted various strategies including outreach
 to schools and communities, exhibitions and youth agricultural festivals as
 well as institution of award schemes for best youth farmers as a way to raise
 interest and awareness on the opportunities that exist within this sector.



• Recycling

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS136_KectilGeneration","                            Over recent years, the world has witnessed an increasing level of waste
                            products as a by-product of the increasing level of population, affluence, and
                            technological advancement in a given environment or society. In Africa we
                            have witnessed increasing level of pollution from plastic, car tires, bottles
                            among others and this has generated innovative thinking among young
                            people to provide a sustainable solution. Over the years, AYICC members have
                            redefined waste as a resource for sustainable development and through
                            various recycling initiatives, they are bringing life into materials that otherwise
                            could have been a nuisance to the environment.

The 1st African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) convened from 26th - 27th
October, 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, on the theme “African Youth Responses to Climate
Change and Food Security, Action from the Frontline.” The conference was organized by Africa
Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) in partnership with Africa Climate Policy Center
(ACPC), New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), Pan African Climate Justice
Alliance (PACJA) and Zimbabwe United Nations Association (ZUNA).
100 youths selected across Africa in the conference addressing the thematic strands of Youth in
Agribusiness; Climate Change and Development in Africa; Sustainable Agriculture and Food
Security; Green Economy and Technology Transfer; Climate Justice and Human Rights; and
Climate Change and Disaster risk reduction participated in this first edition of the African Youth
Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC). This came at a time when Africa as a continent
continues to bear the biggest brunt of climate change due to low resilience and weak capacities,
with the youth despite their huge numbers and innovativeness among the vulnerable alongside
women. Despite the odds, they have been actively engaged in adaptation and mitigation




                                                                   O
initiatives that improve their communities’ resilience to climate change.
The conference therefore provided a platform for the African youths to interact and share best
practices. Five flagship projects were selected to be used as case studies by African Youths in
starting their own projects depending on transferability. The conference also saw the drafting of

(AfriYOCC-2016)

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the environmental challenge of climate
change is already modifying Africa’s economies and livelihoods, health, social structure,
infrastructure and natural systems. Over the years, African youth have proved their potential in
both promoting and implementing climate change adaptation projects in their communities.
Their innovations have continually been adopted in responding to climate change impacts. This
is despite various challenges that include low capacity and education, high rates of poverty and
lack of financial resources. At the same time, African youth have been minimally represented in
the respective country policy processes as well as during the UNFCCC climate change
negotiations. Above 50% of the African population are the youth. This justifies the urgent need
for youth capacity development to respond to climate change and inclusion as key stakeholders
in policy process and negotiations. AYICC aims to spearhead new innovations, look into new
systems of success to share with policy and decision-makers, and generally aim to improve on
the current system which is causing long-term and irreversible degradation to our livelihoods –
as the leading youth organization on climate change in Africa.



                                                                    O

meeting will dilate on the current post 2015 development agenda and the role of young
people in championing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in
Africa.

The delegates shall have an opportunity to visit ongoing Climate Change adaptation and
agribusiness projects in Kenya for hands-on skills and knowledge replicable in their countries.
Consequently, it shall boost the skills and capacities of African youths to substantially contribute
to the process leading towards and during COP 22. Through partnership with both
Governmental and Non-governmental agencies, the conference shall not only negotiate for
more youth representation in the respective country policy processes towards the forthcoming
CoPs and country specific policies, but also provide learning and engagement opportunities for
African youths. This will greatly enhance their current capacity and potential to actively
participate in both national and international platforms for policy formulation and implementation.
The conference will also provide a platform to re-assess the current position of our negotiators
and create awareness about the critical role young people should play in shifting agendas in the
forthcoming Conference of Parties in Marrakech come November 2016. While a 4 day gathering

issues affecting their livelihoods.

African youth have for long been side-lined to the periphery of the substantive civic and policy
issues facing the continent. However, the worst affected are the rural based youths and those
residing in farming communities, peri-urban areas and those from conflict and post conflict
countries. This has resulted in youths from these marginalized communities having no
knowledge and information on the basic climate change science and adaptation and mitigation
mechanisms. The good news though is that there is capacity amongst many young people who
are already in the circles of upcoming academia, policy specialists, lawyers, journalists and
scientists’ alike. These capacities need to be strengthened and skills shared amongst the wider
group of young people on the continent so that best practices are disseminated and resources
are expanded.

While it is an undeniable fact that climate change is affecting all regions globally, especially in
developing countries, the adverse effects in the future is likely to increase if the Paris agreement
is not ratified and effectuated by all parties. And even though a deal was achieved during
COP21 in Paris, the impacts of climate change will definitely continue into the future. This
suggests that young people will have to not just understand what climate change is and how it is




                                                                      O
affecting our world, opportunities that exists within, but most importantly, participate actively into
finding amicable solutions. Young people of Africa have therefore considered it an inherent
imperative to contribute to their future by organizing the 2nd African Youth Conference on
Climate Change in October 2016 under the theme, ‘Making Climate Finance work for




                                                  M
African Youth.’


2.1 CONFERENCE STRATEGY




                                                E
The conference program shall be based on exploring mechanisms to finance climate adaptation
and mitigation through Innovations in agriculture, technology and other sectors. It shall be




                                     D
highly interactive with unique workshop-style design that enables participants to develop their
potential through practical experience. Participants will divide to participate in thematic
workshops and come up with an African Youth position paper and concrete activities to be
included in the African Youth Strategy on Climate Change.

The delegates shall be engaged in pre-conference activities that shall include and not limited to,
mapping of youth climate change and/or mitigation projects within the conference key focus
areas for selection as best practice and include in the African youth climate change adaptation
and mitigation best practices database and handbook and aggressively fundraise towards their
participation and a successful workshop. The conference shall critically examine the various
country positions and the overall continents positions of the African Group of Negotiators, their
achievements and potentials towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It shall
examine the youth voices in these positions and further develop African youth position for
COP22.

We expect 200 youth leaders to participate in this conference. The conference is convened by
the AYICC continental secretariat in collaboration with AYICC Kenya chapter and the member

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is an umbrella youth network of African
based youth organizations, university groups, rural youth groups, schools, and individuals
working on climate change and sustainable development issues. It aims at developing capacity
and strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent need to take action
against the impacts of climate change for both present and future generations.

The initiative (always referred to as the movement) was conceived in Nairobi Kenya 10 years
ago, during the second Conference of Youth (COY2) preceding the 12th Conference of Parties
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC - COP12). The
main reason for its founding was to ensure the inclusion, and active participation of youths from
the south, and specifically Africa, in the international climate change negotiations. This was
needed as the youth are more than half the African population and are most affected by climate
change impacts. They also got massive potential to support the continent to take action on
global warming.

During its formation, it comprised of 8 country chapters and current has grown to 45 country
chapters with over 20,000 members across Africa and the Diaspora. This initiative has provided




                                                                  O
a platform for knowledge, ideas and experiences sharing. It is also an avenue for development
of skills and strategies on youth action on climate change mitigation and adaptation in the
African continent. AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a
platform for them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the




                                               M
UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others.

Since its inception, we have worked in partnership with international youth movements and have




                                             E
played a great role in the establishment of the International Youth Climate Movement whose
youth member organizations are now officially acknowledged by the UNFCCC as the YOUNGO
(Youth NGOs involved in the climate change negotiations process). Since COY2 in Nairobi, it




                                   D
has had youth delegates’ representation in all COP meetings.

In addition to the above, we have had landmark successes that include:
     A reach out programme for a children’s home (Watoto Wema in Ruai) and School
        climate change education program run in selected schools in Kenya.
     Leadership and mentorship programmes especially on volunteerism.
     Community development projects particularly on clean energy (energy saving stoves for
        rural folks)
     Capacity development of youth on agribusiness
     Advocacy campaigns e.g. lobbied for lanes to be set aside along the major highways for
        non-motorised transport especially for cyclists.
     Policy engagements i.e. contributing to the climate change bill 2012,as stakeholders
     Youth Caravan from Kenya to Durban during COP 17

To develop capacity and strong partnerships among African youth to understand the urgent
need to take action against the impacts of climate change for both present and future
generations.
3.2 Our Vision

An African continent with an empowered and united youth, who are proactively involved in the
decision-making processes and in the adoption of sustainable options towards a better climate
and social equity.


3.3 Our Core Objectives

a) To provide a platform for young people in the African Countries to engage in dialogue and
share experiences with regard to youth participation in climate change and sustainable
development.
b) To advocate and lobby for pro-active representation and participation of youth in climate




                                                                O
change and sustainable development activities at a local, national and international level.
c) To build partnerships and mobilize resources for youth and youth organizations to actively
participate in the implementation of climate change response strategies and projects in their
member countries.




                                              M
d) Play a leading role in promoting and implementing climate change education and research,
adaptation and mitigation in Africa.
e) Initiate and support youth leadership processes by creating a platform for transfer of




                                            E
leadership skills and principles of transparent governance.


3.4 Our strategic priorities in achieving these objectives:

   
   
   
   
   
       Policy dialogues

       Communication and Education
       Precaution strategies
                                  D
       Networking and partnerships, including South/South and South/North


       Research, Advocacy and Action Learning

Our charter (Charter of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change) can be found on
www.ayicc.net.
Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any
financial assistance, the greatest resource being the time and skills that the leadership
committee and members contribute. However, in order to scale up our actions and make AYICC
vision a reality, there is need for more human and financial resources.

African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) 2016

African Youth Conference on Climate Change will take place in Nairobi in Kenya. The conference is organized by the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change
(AYICC) and the African Climate Policy Centre from the 10 to 13 October 2016. AYICC marks its 10th Anniversary since its fonmation in 2006 during the second
Conference of Youth (COY 2) preceding COP 12.

African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) www.ayicc.net is a continental youth network that was conceived in 2006 in Nairobi Kenya, during the
Conference of Youth held just before the UNFCCC COP12. This initiative has continued to link, and share knowledge, ideas, experiences, skills and strategies
on youth action around the continent on climate change, its mitigation and adaptation and sustainable development. In 2009, AYICC was granted observer
status to the African Minister Conference on Environment (AMCEN). AYICC has been identified by most youth to have the potential to provide a platform for
them to address their regional challenges at such international gatherings as the Conference of Parties of UNFCCC, CBD, UNCSD, among others. AYICC
currently operates in over 45 African countries with over 20,000 members.

In response, to the call by AU Heads of Sates and Government to establish the CAHOSCC Youth Programme on Climate Change (CYPCC),
(Assembly/AU/Dec.538{XXIII}) and cognizant of the key role played by African youths in climate change mitigation and adaptation and overall sustainable
development. AYICC is convening the Second African Youth Conference on Climate Change (AfriYOCC) from the 10 to 13 October 2016, after the successful
hosting of the first edition held from 26th to 27th October 2015 in Victoria Falls, Zimababwe.       ~


AfriYOCC 2016, shall provide an avenue for African youths to showcase their climate change adaptation
and mitigation strategies, projects and initiatives. Best practices arising from the various AYICC country
chapters shall be showcased and the African youth climate change adaptation and mitigation best
practices data base and handbook launched .

Founding Opportunities


AYICC Founding Opportunities

Globally, Africa is seen as a continent particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The anticipated detrimental impacts associated with the
environmental challenge of climate change will ultimately modify Africa's economies and livelihoods, health, social structure, infrastructure and natural
systems. To date little has been done to empower, capacitate and mobilise youth, particularly in Africa to address global environmental challenges such as
climate change. facebook d o w n ~ To remedy this, an initial step has been the formation of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC).

The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change was formed partially in response to the poor representation of young Africans at the International Youth
Summit on Climate Change (November 24-28, 2005), which was held in conjunction with the United Nation's Climate Change Conference (November 28-
December 10, 2005) in Montreal , Canada. The overall mission of AYICC is to ensure that African youth are equipped toparticipate in future UNFCCC
meetings and other global initiatives for sustainable solutions to environmental degradation and climate change.

In order to ensure a strong youth presence in climate change dialogue and fora, there is a need for AYICC to ensure youth representation from various parts
of Africa. This will enable Africa's youth to engage with the global youth movement, governments and NGO's in a more coordinated and sustained manner.
The long term goal is to ensure sustainable and systematic global youth action, with special emphasis on African youth on the issue of climate change.

Presently the concept of AYICC has been taken forward by African youth in the absence of any financial assistance. The planning committee members have
volunteered their time and their contributions. However, in order to make this vision a reality we need to become a financially viable organisation. For this
reason, we would like to request your financial assistance in getting this vision off the ground.•

YOUTH STATEMNET AT THE OPENING FORUM OF THE SEVENTH AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FORUM, 12TH OCTOBER

2010: Ms. Esther Agbarakwe, Nigeria




The Chair,

Climate Change poses significant challenges to future generations. As youth we have a stake in this future; it is our future.




                                                                                                                 O
As the 7th African Development Forum, we have indeed come of age, we are no longer in our childhood stages of determining sustainable development - the
time of maturity has arrived. This year is marked as the International Year of Youth and now, more than ever before, the youth are taking a stand. More than
anyone else, we, the Youth, face unprecedented challenges as a result of global climate change. We also share the responsibility of addressing ii. As a group,
we are key moral stakeholders in the international processes treating the most important challenge of our generation. As it is our future, we will be
disproportionately affected by the catastrophic impacts of climate change.

Advocacy and Behavior Change: II is critical for present and future leaders to collaborate on finding solutions. The need for cultural transformation in our time




                                                                              M
is stronger than ever. This transformation - that enables us to shift towards a more sustainable world - should be an organic process, guided by principles of
compassion, integrity and justice. We need to pragmatically rethink our behavioral patterns, to enable a paradigm shift that is based on an ongoing process of
action, reflection and meaningful participation. Awareness, education and empowerment are fundamental prerequisites to enabling this process, and the youth
are energetic and passionate about holding governments and all relevant stakeholders involved accountable for their actions. We are equal partners in this
process and commit ourselves fully to achieving the objectives as decided by this Forum.




                                                                            E
Contrary to what is believed; young people play a dynamic role in framing and implementing policies. So their role goes beyond advocacy. From an advocacy
perspective, young people are involved in songs and stories which spread awareness in local languages. Of course we understand the importance and
relevance of this because 70% of Africa is based in rural areas and the term Climate Change is foreign, Young people are finding ways of using words in local
languages to translate the message across.




                                                           D
It is time to shift the balance of decision-making towards the generation that will have to manage this unwanted inheritance, to make political and economic
decisions that can span a generation, and to enable real inter-generational and inter-cultural dialogue about climate change to be realized in institutions where
the youth generation can learn.

However at the same time a range of social learning and marketing approaches need to be developed to address the gap between classroom education styles
and education that stimulates real action. This gap prevents the cultural shift from token awareness to personal action and reaction.

Education: In relation to climate change, African Governments should begin at inception to mainstream youth voices and perceptions. This is particularly
important because climate change projections indicate that effects will begin to be most felt in the next 20-30 years - young people should begin to be part of
the solution so that they will be able to cope when disaster calls. Involving them in this programme will ensure that those who will be affected will have direct
knowledge of the challenges and strategies for coping as well as the ability to mobilize communities to respond to and prepare for the impact of climate change
and natural disasters.

Governments must give credence to the higher learning education system in Africa in particular the increased accent on improvement of research and
innovation on climate change specifically highlighting on policy and reform, the programmes, pedagogy and teaching tools. This will enhance an equipped pool
of intellectual capital among the young people on climate change issues who will replicate this to the various organizations and networks that they are part of.

Al government level, during the last Conference of the Parties (COP), ii was pleasing to see that many African delegations included youth and gave them a role
to play. Furthermore, many youth who were involved in COP 15 deliberations have been interacting with their various governments and engaging in processes
and procedures that are related to Climate change policy. There is an understanding that more needs to be done, and at this forum, I urge you to engage young
people who knock on your doors asking to be involved.

Youth and youth based NGOs play a major role either in strengthening local capacity to cope or by supporting local action. Already, groups such as the Nigerian
Youth Coalition and the African youth Climate Initiative-Kenya have established school climate clubs, which are creative ways to engage young people; these
initiatives should be mainstreamed into education systems. Young people in this governance process are important because successful adaptation requires a
host of innovative measures developed with vulnerable communities to improve their present and future livelihoods. Young people are vibrant and are able to
access places that many governmental institutions fail to access. As the majority of the population and Africa's future, it is important to include them in this
impending crisis that is Climate Change.

Already, this conference calls for integrated approaches to enable African countries to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change. There is a dire need
to have a clearer understanding of the potential calamities that climate change can bring and to start the discourse on how best to stave off the worst impacts.
There is already an understanding that

Climate Change is not a localized problem but transcends national borders, hence the need for co-operation of Intergovernmental agencies but also to include
those young and vulnerable people.

Conclusion :
"
"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS143_AfricanYouthCouncilonClimateChange","No longer can climate change be seen as merely an environmental problem or an energy challenge. It is a combination of both, which needs the involvement of
young people to preserve the environment and enter into green energy careers.

It's important for all of us to recognize that sustainable development isn't just a catch phrase - people all over the continent are taking it into their own hands. A
couple days ago over 300 community events took place in nearly every country on the continent of Africa, and more than 7000 globally as part of the Global
Work Party on 10/10/10.

Everywhere in the wortd, people planted trees, cultivated community gardens, installed solar panels, made buildings more efficient and implemented thousands
of other grassroots solutions to the climate crisis. We got to work everywhere in the world, but we need you, leaders, to get to work, too.

Thank you and God bless

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS143_AfricanYouthCouncilonClimateChange","The 25th session of the Conference Parties (COP25) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held from the 2 -13
December bringing together nearly 27000 people to the Spanish capital. COP25
provided parties with the opportunity to finalize the ""rulebook"" of the Paris
Agreement - the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020.


In the spirit of the convention on climate change young people continue to enjoy




                                                                          O
various spaces during COP mainly through YOU NGO; the official youth
constituency to the UNFCCC. Article 6 ofthe Convention and Article 12 of the
Paris Agreement referred to as Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) encourage
the empowerment of every member of the society to take climate actions and
therefore young people who are most vulnerable to the climate crisis are




                                             M
increasingly becoming the centre of discussion.


The world today is home to the largest generation of young people in history and
their energy, creativity, and innovation, when harnessed properly, will accelerate




                                           E
sustainable solutions to the global crisis. Youth have a pivotal role to play in the
implementation of ACE which consists of six elements namely: education,
training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and
international cooperation.




                             D
At COP25, the Intergenerational Inquiry which is a highlight event of Young and
Future Generations Day and like every year provided a platform for youth and
decision-makers to discuss how young people can enhance the implementation
of the Paris Agreement. This platform was attended by the Executive Secretary of
the UNFCCC and provided an opportunity for young people to share the
outcome on the Conference of Youth (COY 15) to the secretariat.


The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) has continued to
empower and mobilize young people at COP through our side events and
exhibitions. Through an exhibition at COP 25, AYICC was able to showcase the
actions and contributions of African youth in the fight against climate change.
Such actions include ecological restorations, renewable energy promotion, and
local conference of youth hosted by our national chapters.


AYICC's greatest concern however, is with regards to the low representation of
African youth at the UNFCCC sessions. There are many contributing factors which
includes lack of funding, inability to assess accreditations and visas. As the first
step in addressing this, we will continue to encourage African countries to make
conscious efforts to include youth delegates in their official delegations for COPs.
We also call on development partners and stakeholders who are interested in
youth development to reach out with their support to AYICC to enhance African
youth participation in this important global process.

Climate Change


• Campaigns and Advocacy
 The African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC) is widely known for our
 incessant campaigns and research-based advocacy on environmental and
 climate change topics. Since 2006 AYICC has been consistent with its
 campaigns impressing on African governments and international community
 alike to deliver on their commitment under the United Nations Framework
 Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) .



• Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)
 Climate change education, training, and awareness creation have been the
 central focus of AYICC targeting youth and vulnerable communities. We do
 this through workshops, conferences, and webinars leveraging on our robust
 online presence. Through our Flagship program; the African Youth Conference
 on Climate Change (AFRIYOCC) we are able to provide a platform for




                                                                     O
 exchange of ideas and sharing of knowledge and best practices among young
 African thereby feeding into article 6 of the climate change convention and
 article 12 of the Paris Agreement.



• Tree planting and Ecological restoration



                                         M
 Trees contribute to their environment by providing oxygen, improving air
 quality, climate amelioration, conserving water, preserving soil, and




                                       E
 supporting wildlife. Beyond the campaigns and advocacies, our member
 organizations embark on tree planting and reforestation activities including
 mangrove restoration along the coast.




                         D
• Renewable energy promotion
 With the increasing demand for energy for industrial and economic
 development, AYICC member organizations in different countries are
 promoting renewable energy access to isolated off-grid communities. AYICC
 believes that Youth-led renewable energy enterprises are a viable means of
 achieving sustainable development, as they promote technologies that are
 less harmful to the global environs while at the same time providing
 sustainable income-generating opportunities for youth .



• Youth in Agribusiness
 AYICC sees agriculture as an essential driver of economic development and an
 area of great opportunity for young people in Africa. The challenge, however,
 is that the growing youth population does not see agriculture as a profitable
 opportunity due to their lack of insight into the opportunities that exist within
 the agriculture value chain. Through our member organizations who are youth
 farmers themselves, AYICC has adopted various strategies including outreach
 to schools and communities, exhibitions and youth agricultural festivals as
 well as institution of award schemes for best youth farmers as a way to raise
 interest and awareness on the opportunities that exist within this sector.



• Recycling

"/Users/Ela 1/Documents/LDT Mac/7. ProfessionalDevelopment/SICSS_Project/SICSS-Project-African-Youth-Leadership/Webscraped data/AYLS143_AfricanYouthCouncilonClimateChange","                            Over recent years, the world has witnessed an increasing level of waste
                            products as a by-product of the increasing level of population, affluence, and
                            technological advancement in a given environment or society. In Africa we
                            have witnessed increasing level of pollution from plastic, car tires, bottles
                            among others and this has generated innovative thinking among young
                            people to provide a sustainable solution. Over the years, AYICC members have
                            redefined waste as a resource for sustainable development and through
                            various recycling initiatives, they are bringing life into materials that otherwise
                            could have been a nuisance to the environment.
